Abstract,Keywords,Title,Urls
"The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (""MISEV"") guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these ""MISEV2014"" guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points.","

"Background:
        
      
      The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry sector has high rates of occupational injuries. Fishing has globally particularly high occupational fatality rates, but injuries and illnesses to people working in its sub-sectors, aquaculture and fish farming, are not well understood.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This study characterised injuries and occupational diseases to fish farmers and people employed on fish farms in Finland using national employment and accident insurance (workers' compensation) data.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      A total of 392 injuries and 18 occupational diseases were compensated during 1996 to 2015 to fish farmers and people employed on fish farms in Finland. The average injury rate was 3.2 injuries per 100 employed persons with no significant trend over time. Two of the injuries were fatal. Injured persons were primarily male (87.2%), in 45-54 year age group (39.1%), and working in coastal areas (49%). Com- mon injury characteristics included: incident type: slips, trips, and falls (37%); location: building, structure or ground level surface (28%); injured body part: hand or finger (25%); type of injury: dislocation, sprain, strain (35%); and lost worktime: 1 to 2 weeks (26.9%). Seven out of 18 occupational diseases occurred to women, most resulting in cumulative trauma from fish processing.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The injury rate in fish farming corresponds to rate in all industries combined in Finland, and is higher than the rate in available Nordic statistics on fish farming. Fish farming injuries could be reduced further by slip resistant surfaces, protection of hands and fingers and ergonomics in processing.","

"Fishing is a dangerous and financially risky way to make a living, but it attracts many participants that prefer it to higher paying and safer jobs. Based on a survey of over 1400 U.S. West Coast fishing vessel owners we use factor analysis and structural equation modeling to quantify distinct latent variables representing job satisfaction related to non-monetary versus monetary aspects of fishing and measures of identity and social capital associated with being a fisher. We show that these latent variables have distinct effects on (stated) fishery participation behavior and that higher non-monetary job satisfaction, social capital, and identity, are associated with a willingness to forgo higher income to be a fisher. Understanding how these factors affect and are affected by participation in fisheries could be important to increase benefits from fisheries and to ensure sustainability of management regimes that rely on indirect controls on effort to limit catch.","

"Background:
        
      
      Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Goals:
        
      
      (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.

          Environmental findings:
        
      
      Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Ecosystem findings:
        
      
      Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Human health findings:
        
      
      Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Recommendations:
        
      
      World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.",,"

      Aquaculture has many occupational hazards, including those that are physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, and mechanical. The risks in aquaculture are inherent, as this activity requires particular practices. The objective of the present study was to show the risks associated with the aquaculture sector and present a critical overview on the Brazilian public policies concerning aquaculture occupational health. Methods include online research involved web searches and electronic databases including Pubmed, Google Scholar, Scielo and government databases. We conducted a careful revision of Brazilian labor laws related to occupational health and safety, rural workers, and aquaculture. The results and conclusion support the idea that aquaculture requires specific and well-established industry programs and policies, especially in developing countries. Aquaculture still lacks scientific research, strategies, laws, and public policies to boost the sector with regard to occupational health and safety. The establishment of a safe workplace in aquaculture in developing countries remains a challenge for all involved in employer-employee relationships.

"Objectives: In 2017 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Committee on Fisheries committed to prioritize occupational safety and health issues in aquaculture (AOSH). An international team was established to synthesize OSH knowledge concerning more than 19 million, often vulnerable, aquaculture workers found globally.Methods: The study was conducted as a desktop scoping exercise using both peer-reviewed and gray literature and the knowledge and expertize of an international panel. Collated information used a standard proforma. Panel members developed draft national and regional AOSH profiles outlining occupational hazards contributing to occupational injuries, diseases, and known solutions. These were work-shopped and refined after gathering additional information and used to compile the first global scoping review report on AOSH.Results: Synthesized results revealed multiple hazards, significant global knowledge gaps and some successful and unsuccessful global, national and industry-specific AOSH policies, practices and standards along the primary supply chain, in marine and freshwater contexts. Some constructive initiatives by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and FAO, industry, labor and civil society groups in a range of employment and geographical settings and across diverse populations of workers were identified.Conclusion: Global commitment to AOSH should be given the same focus as product quality, biosecurity, food safety and environmental sustainability in the sector. This needs development and implementation of integrated AOSH actions appropriate for diverse settings especially in low and middle-income countries encompassing greater uptake of international codes, better risk assessment and OSH management, adoption of technological innovations, effective OSH regulation and enforcement, adequate resources, training and information.","

"Information on occupational health and safety practices in Brazilian aquaculture is limited. This paper reports preliminary results from an online survey based on research questions to identify occupational hazards, risk assessment practices, and prevention measures adopted in Brazilian aquaculture. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, comprising 25 questions, on a voluntary and anonymous basis. Aquaculture stakeholders were invited to participate in the study through email and social media channels. The demographic data demonstrated that the majority of respondents were men (72%) and having a higher education (95%). Most respondents employed administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) rather than substitution and other risk elimination measures to reduce exposure. The most commonly adopted measures were PPE use (87%), adequate handling of chemicals (86%), and imparting knowledge of risks (90%). However, only 12% of participants reported the presence of safety protocols at their workplace, and 17% had some form of immunization of workers. In this study, it was possible to identify a lack of hazard signage in the workplace and lack of occupational health and safety training. The results further indicate that risk management in aquaculture continues to be a challenge in low-income countries. Aquaculture farmers should be encouraged and supported in adopting measures and appropriate technologies to eliminate risks in Brazilian aquaculture.","

"A scoping project was funded by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2017 on the health and safety of aquaculture workers. This project developed a template covering basic types of aquaculture production, health and safety hazards and risks, and related data on injuries and occupational ill health, regulations, social welfare conditions, and labour and industry activity in the sector. Profiles using the template were then produced for key aquaculture regions and nations across the globe where information could be obtained. These revealed both the scale and depth of occupational safety and health (OSH) challenges in terms of data gaps, a lack of or poor risk assessment and management, inadequate monitoring and regulation, and limited information generally about aquaculture OSH. Risks are especially high for offshore/marine aquaculture workers. Good practice as well as barriers to improving aquaculture OSH were noted. The findings from the profiles were brought together in an analysis of current knowledge on injury and work-related ill health, standards and regulation, non-work socioeconomic factors affecting aquaculture OSH, and the role of labour and industry in dealing with aquaculture OSH challenges. Some examples of governmental and labour, industry and non-governmental organisation good practice were identified. Some databases on injury and disease in the sector and research initiatives that solved problems were noted. However, there are many challenges especially in rural and remote areas across Asia but also in the northern hemisphere that need to be addressed. Action now is possible based on the knowledge available, with further research an important but secondary objective.","

"Objectives: Maritime health and safety research primarily comes from developed industrial countries, with sparse contributions from developing countries. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the research in Latin American fishery to point out the need for research and prevention in this part of the world.Methods: A systematic search was carried out with Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar, Google Academico, SciELO, Pan American Journal of Public Health, Medicina Maritima, and other relevant Spanish- and English-language journals in Latin America (1984-2018). By using the ICD-10 system we were able to identify the most important studies related to the research questions.Results: A total of 143 scientific articles were identified under the criteria. After duplicates, administrative reports, and conference abstracts were removed, 110 original articles were screened. Of those, 89 peer-reviewed articles on fishermen's health and safety fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the final evaluation. Brazil accounted for the largest share (49), while eight other countries had one to nine studies (and the rest zero). Study objectives included occupational injuries, cancer, divers' disease, skin diseases, hearing loss, ergonomic problems, and environmental pollution. Non-fatal and fatal accident studies in fishing were absent.Conclusion: The lack of occupational injury studies is striking, and it urgently calls for establishing injury registers and monitoring safety in fishing. Among the occupational diseases, pityriasis of the eyes and different types of skin cancer (related ultraviolet radiation exposure) need critical attention and prevention. The scant number of epidemiological studies calls for collaborative international research to establish preventive polices and activities in fishing.","

      The emergence of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has broadened the policy scope of fisheries management by accounting for the biological and ecological connectivity of fisheries. Less attention, however, has been given to the economic connectivity of fisheries. If fishers consider multiple fisheries when deciding where, when, and how much to fish, then management changes in one fishery can generate spillover impacts in other fisheries. Catch-share programs are a popular fisheries management framework that may be particularly prone to generating spillovers given that they typically change fishers' incentives and their subsequent actions. We use data from Alaska fisheries to examine spillovers from each of the main catch-share programs in Alaska. We evaluate changes in participation-a traditional indicator in fisheries economics-in both the catch-share and non-catch-share fisheries. Using network analysis, we also investigate whether catch-share programs change the economic connectivity of fisheries, which can have implications for the socioeconomic resilience and robustness of the ecosystem, and empirically identify the set of fisheries impacted by each Alaska catch-share program. We find that cross-fishery participation spillovers and changes in economic connectivity coincide with some, but not all, catch-share programs. Our findings suggest that economic connectivity and the potential for cross-fishery spillovers deserve serious consideration, especially when designing and evaluating EBFM policies.

"Kerala, a maritime state on the west coast of peninsular India, constitutes approximately 10% of India's total coastline and claims a 20% share in national marine fish production. The registered fishing fleet consists of about 29,969 motorized, 4248 mechanized, and 2515 non-motorized crafts. This study was done to assess occupational hazards faced by fishers as well as the usage of sea safety devices (SSDs) in Kerala. Information was collected from 180 mechanized, motorized, and traditional boat owners. The study revealed that capsizing, sinking, grounding, burning, collision, mishaps, man overboard, and injuries were common occupational hazards. SSDs used were life buoy, life jacket, first aid kit, emergency rations, fire extinguisher, fire bucket, global positioning system, magnetic compass, emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), sonar, echo sounder, oil lamp, signaling torch, and batteries. Fishers with mechanized boats had high knowledge and used most SSDs. Fishers with motorized boats had adequate knowledge but less SSD usage. Traditional and small-scale fishers did not use most SSDs. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis statistical test revealed a significant difference in regards to usage between mechanized, motorized, and traditional fishers, indicating there are gaps in usage of SSDs between the three groups of fishers. It is necessary to educate and motivate fishers with motorized and traditional boats to use SSDs.","

"Background: All over the world, commercial fishing is known to be a hazardous occupation. Although several causal analyses of occupational accidents have been published in recent years, knowledge of the prevalence of sick leave, diagnosis and hospitalization among workers on board Norwegian fishing vessels is still sparse.Objective: The objective of this study is to provide new knowledge about the prevalence of doctor-certified sick leave among Norwegian fishers compared to an age- and gender-matched control population. A comparison of diagnoses and hospitalizations between these groups is also presented.Methods: A sample of fishers (n = 25,971) was selected by Statistics Norway (SSB), based on occupation as fishers in 2008-2013. An age- and gender-matched control population (n = 77,913) was also selected. Outpatient consultation and hospitalization data were received from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR).Results: Fishers have significantly lower rates of sick leave than the general working population as a whole, but a significantly higher rate sick leave than an age- and gender-matched control population. The most common cause of sick leave in both fishers and controls was musculoskeletal problems. Fishers had a higher number of hospital stays than the control group; the stays were more often unscheduled and lasted longer than those of the control group.Conclusion: The results emphasize the continued need for preventive occupational health strategies in the fishing industry.","

"Primary production has always been considered the weak link in the entire food production chain (from farm to fork) and, due also to the grave health and food emergencies that have taken place over the years (BSE, dioxin, avian flu etc.), greater attention has been focused on the production stage, together with the need to regain the consumers' faith. To preserve and support small farms in a local setting and, consistent with the aims of flexibility and respecting the main requisites contained in the EC Regulations (No. 852/2004; No. 853/2004) (European Commission, 2004; 2004a), production is allowed for tastingadministration on the premises and the processing and sales of agricultural products produced exclusively on the farm, such as: fresh meat from poultry and rabbits and small farmed wild animals; processed meats obtained from animals raised on the farm and from hunting; fishing and aquaculture products; raw milk for direct human consumption and dairy products; eggs, honey, fruit and vegetables, woodland products; jams and preserved fruit, flours, vegetable preserves, wild above ground and underground mushrooms; dried fruits, fruit juices, cereals, syrups; oil, wine, bread and baked products. This possibility is reserved for individual farmers or co-operatives, registered in the company register according to Article 8 of the Law 29th December 1993 No. 580 (Italian Republic, 1993); who may sell directly inside and outside farm, products coming mainly from the respective farms, observing the current regulations regarding health and hygiene. All this should provide an instrument for rural and competitive development for the entire European agricultural production chain strongly influenced by the marketing conditions imposed by the mass retailing groups on their own suppliers. Not least is the possibility of creating work and occupation and adequately counteracting the phenomenon of the depopulation of the countryside, encouraging the return to agricultural activities on the part of young people; and, consequently, a form of safeguarding the environment by reducing the costs linked to hydro-geological instability and soil maintenance. This trend, together with the national directions, may represent a support even for small local farms which, taking advantage of simplified procedures consistent with the objectives of flexibility of the community Regulations (EC) (No. 852/2004; No. 853/2004) (European Commission, 2004; 2004a), may take part in the promotion of agricultural markets managed directly by the farmers as sales points for local products (farmers' markets), so as to guarantee a fairer price and consolidate the territorial link between production and consumption (short distribution chain or short circuit). Without, of course, renouncing the necessary prerequisites for placing any food on the market: health-hygiene; traceability; health and well-being of the animals; safeguarding of the environment and the plants.","

"Researchers involved in community-based participatory research often face challenges due to numerous dynamic factors, including the physical location of the study population, willingness to participate, language barriers, cultural norms, social stigmas, and unpredictable weather and other disasters. Investigators who work with commercial fishermen are all too familiar with these potential obstacles and barriers to performing occupational safety and health research. Such has been the case along the Texas and Louisiana gulf coasts, where the burden of occupational fatalities in the shrimp fishery remains high. Moreover, the need for strategic community, regulatory agency, and research partnerships in order to explore solutions that can help to reduce this burden is ongoing. The IFISH 5 conference and the panel session described in this brief report offered a venue to acknowledge and create awareness of these barriers and opportunities for developing sustainable solutions that can have an impact on this loss of life. The approach taken was to explore the perspectives of a panel of regional collaborators including two researchers, an outreach community liaison, and a marine safety and health official from the U. S. Coast Guard. Key barriers emerging from the panel fell into four themes, each emphasized by one of the four panel members, allowing for discussion of potential solutions. The themes included: (1) language gap; (2) cultural influences and use of personal flotation devices; (3) relationships with the community; and (4) enforcement agency role as a trusted opinion leader. This panel session can readily serve as a model to promote similar exploration of barriers and solutions in commercial fishing across other regions of the US and internationally as well.","Keywords:

All participants were men and had a regular activity for at least 2 years. It included an individual questionnaire, a clinical examination and a technical visit to the workplace Results: The skin disorders were palmar hyperkeratosis in 67.1% of fishermen, plantar hyperkeratosis in 59.4%, scares in 52.2%, facial wrinkling in 32%, and marine stings in 11.2%. The skin infections were fungal (44.4%), bacterial (8.3%), viral (5.5%) and scabies (1%). Only 192 (17.4%) fishermen did not have any dermatologic disease, 43% had one type of dermatologic diseases, 27.2% two types, 9.5% three types and 2.5% four types. Concerning personal protective equipment, only 87.4% wore protective clothing, 12.8% high visibility clothing, 52.6% safety shoes, 30.1% protective gloves, and 63.5% protective caps or hats. Only, 12% knew that mycosis were infectious origin and were contagious. Eighty-two per cent ignored the mode of contamination, 78% the means of prevention and 91% the existence of a medical treatment. Ninety-five per cent thought that pityriasis versicolor was due to sunrays especially in summer and not to fungus.

"Fishing industry workers are at high risk for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and injuries. Prescription opioids used to treat pain injuries may put these workers at increased risk for developing substance disorders. Using a Community-Based Participatory Research approach, formative research was conducted to inform the eventual development of relevant interventions to prevent and reduce opioid use disorders among fishing industry workers. Qualitative interviews (n = 21) were conducted to assess: knowledge and attitudes about opioid use disorders; features of fishing work that might affect use and/or access to treatment; and community and organizational capacity for prevention and treatment. Participants reported numerous pathways connecting commercial fishing with opioid use. The combination of high stress and physically tasking job duties requires comprehensive workplace interventions to prevent chronic pain and MSDs, in addition to tailored and culturally responsive treatment options to address opioid use disorders in this population. Public health programs must integrate workplace health and safety protection along with evidence-based primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions in order to address opioid use disorders, particularly among workers in strenuous jobs.","

"The seafood supply chain is often long and fragmented, and slavery is a tenacious problem. The vast majority of workers are engaged in the early stages of production and often employed through subcontracts or brokers. We hypothesized that food companies could identify risks and implement improvements by adding a labor safety dimension to their tracking and traceability systems. We designed a five-point framework-the Labor Safe Screen-and tested it for 118 products. The framework combines the use of technology in existing platforms with the collection of industry data and authoritative human rights data. Eighteen food companies used three or more components of the framework and systematically documented their supply chains, engaged suppliers, and cross-checked results. The companies were able to identify areas where working conditions met minimum principles, were unknown, or were inadequate. Three companies also incorporated direct worker feedback to focus resources and improve working conditions. We conclude that food companies can effectively and efficiently assess and reduce risks of forced labor in seafood supply chains-not to claim ""no slavery"" but to greatly improve their awareness of the labor conditions in the making of the products they trade and to identify feasible targets for further diligence and remedies.",,"

Insurance claims data for self-employed Finnish commercial fishers during the years 1996 through 2015 (n = 1951) were analysed to assess predictors for occupational injuries and diseases. Out of the available variables, fishery location, career length, and participation in the voluntary occupational health service programme were not significant predictors. Male gender (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.37-2.99), Finnish mother tongue vs. Swedish (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.53-2.55), and higher income levels from fishing (four income categories, OR range: 1.71-3.53) were associated with higher odds for a compensated occupational injury or disease claim among commercial fishers in the final multivariate model. The identified risk groups could be targeted for interventions, and the content of the occupational health service programme should be developed to gain protective effect.","

      Most compartments registered SPLs greater than 80 dBA and the noisiest compartment was the engine-room, where the vessel pilot works. Among the fishermen, tinnitus was the most commonly reported symptom (48.63%). A higher prevalence of hearing loss was observed in engine-room keepers. Longer the length of time in service, and consequently, exposure to noise (in years), were associated with higher auditory thresholds.

The prevalence of stress was higher in subjects with dependents (69.1%) versus 30.9% without dependents, and among those living alone (61%) versus 47.5% among those living in couple. The prevalence of harmful habits was 68.5% for tobacco smoking or snuff, 36.8% for cannabis smoking, 35.4% for alcohol consumption, 8.6% for other psychotropic substances and medications, and 21.4% for antalgic drugs. These toxic habits were significantly higher in stressed individuals. Thirty-three point seven per cent had self-reported chronic pathologies (40.5% among stressed vs. 25.7% non-stressed). Thirty-four per cent were overweight (38.3% among stressed vs. 28.8% non-stressed), and 14% obese (19.3% among stressed vs. 7.6% non-stressed). The average daily working hours were 11.2 h (12.8 h among stressed subjects vs. 10.5 h non-stressed). Psychological demand was higher in stressed subjects, while decisional latitude and social support were lower. Psychosomatic symptoms were higher among stressed than non-stressed. The main suggestions of the fishermen were to improve income, social welfare, health insurance, safety on board, quality of lifestyle, sport and leisure activities, information and awareness campaigns of occupational stress, and fight against addictive behaviours.

"Diseases have been recognized as the major obstacle to the shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) aquaculture production in Bangladesh. This study provides an assessment of shrimp and prawn diseases/syndromes, health management practices, and occupational health hazards associated with the handling of chemical and biological products to prevent and treat shrimp and prawn diseases. A survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire with 380 shrimp and prawn farmers in the southwest of Bangladesh during February and June of 2016. The farms were categorized on the basis of the three cropping patterns: shrimp polyculture, prawn polyculture, and shrimp and prawn polyculture. Eight different diseases and/or symptoms were reported by the surveyed farmers. The white spot disease and the broken antenna and rostrum symptom were the most common in shrimp and prawn species, respectively. In total, 35 chemical and biological products (4 antibiotics, 15 disinfectants, 13 pesticides, 2 feed additives and probiotics) were used to treat and/or prevent diseases in the all farm categories. The major constraints for disease management were limited access to disease diagnostic service, inadequate product application information and lack of knowledge on better management practices. Handling chemicals and preparation of medicated feed with bare hands was identified as a potential occupational health hazard. This study suggests improvements in farmers' knowledge and skill in disease diagnostics and health management practices, and appropriate handling of potentially hazardous chemicals.","

"Objectives: The study objective was to estimate a denominator of exposure to inshore lobstering in Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs), to count incident injury data from a sample cohort of this population, to use this count to calculate rates for incident injuries, and to use official counts of fatalities to estimate a fatality rate.Methods: Captains were randomly selected from those licensed to fish in Maine and Massachusetts. Data on work exposure and injuries that occurred on the boat were collected using a survey that was administered once per season via phone or face-to-face interview with the captain. Data included self-reports of the number of weeks worked during the season, average crew size, number of trips per week, and average trip length in hours. In addition, this survey captured relevant information (body segment affected, type of injury, and whether treatment was received) on all acute injuries occurring during the season. Only data on acute injuries were collected, and defined as having newly occurred within the last 3 months. Counts of fatalities were obtained from an official surveillance database at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety.Results: The total occupational exposure reported for the cohort was over 2 million man-hours over 4 years, resulting in an average annual FTE of 5,847. The fatality rate averaged over 4 years was 21/100,000 FTE. The incidence rates for all injuries (51.0/100 FTE) and injuries receiving treatment (17.5/100 FTE) were much higher than those reported in other studies of fishing that used US Coast Guard data. Lobstermen presented with all categories of injuries, sprains being the most frequent (7.8/100 FTE) and amputations the least (0.2/100 FTE). Wrist/hand injuries on the right side occurred most frequently of all body locations (3.6/100 FTE).Conclusion: Non-fatal injuries occur at high rates in lobstering. The impact of interventions aimed at exposure to risk for sprains and cuts has potential to affect the most lobstermen. Fatality rate appears to have been unchanging since the year 2000.","

      We conducted a pre-season survey of Dungeness crab fishermen during 2015 to 2016. Community researchers administered surveys to fishermen. Respondents reported their opinions about factors contributing to injuries and staying safe, which were grouped into similar themes by consen- sus.

      Four hundred twenty-six surveys were completed. Injury causation perceptions were sorted into 17 categories, and staying safe perceptions were sorted into 13 categories. The most frequently cited causes of injury were heavy workload (86, 21.9%), poor mental focus (78, 19.9%), and inexperience (56, 14.3%). The most frequently cited factors in staying safe while fishing were awareness (142, 36.1%), good and well-maintained fishing gear/vessel (41, 10.4%), and best marine practices (39, 9.9%). Opinions were not significantly associated with experiencing an injury in the past while fishing, but some opinions were significantly associated with crew position, age, and years of experience.

"Progress towards the South African Government's social upliftment targets on food security, equity, job creation and economic development can be made by diversification of fish production in the country's aquaculture sector. The risks associated with the diseases and parasitic infections that affect aquaculture production in South Africa are poorly understood. Substantial investment is currently being made to provide evidence of freedom from OIE-listed diseases to support an aquaculture industry that is largely reliant on access to foreign markets for high-value aquacultural products. The projected rapid expansion of the aquaculture sector in South Africa accentuates the associated need to prevent the spread of aquatic animal diseases. The primary constraint is that the current regulatory framework governing aquacultural activities is not centralised due to the diversity of aquaculture activities spanning marine, brackish and freshwater environments. An aquaculture development bill was drafted in 2018 to promote aquacultural development. The effective implementation of the provisions of the bill requires resources to ensure that suitable standards for aquatic animal health management are achieved in accordance with international standards and government policies and objectives.","

"The 2303 Wetlands of International Importance distribute unevenly in different continents. Europe owns the largest number of sites, while Africa has the largest area of sites. More than half of the sites are affected by three or four impact factors (55%). The most significant impact factors are pollution (54%), biological resources use (53%), natural system modification (53%), and agriculture and aquaculture (42%). The main affected objects are land area and environment of the wetlands, occurred in 75% and 69% of the sites, respectively. The types most affected by land area occupation are river wetlands and lake wetlands, the types with the greatest impact on environment are marine/coastal wetlands and river wetlands, the type with the greatest impact on biodiversity is river wetlands, the types most affected by water resources regulation are marsh wetlands and river wetlands, and the types most affected by climate change are lake wetlands and marine/coastal wetlands. About one-third of the wetland sites have been artificially reconstructed. However, it is found that the proportions of natural wetland sites not affected or affected by only one factor are generally higher than that of wetland sites both containing natural wetlands and human-made wetlands, while the proportions of wetland sites both containing natural wetlands and human-made wetlands affected by three or four factors are generally higher than that of natural wetland sites. Wetland sites in the UK and Ireland are least affected among all countries. Wetland management plans in different regions still have large space for improvement, especially in Africa and Asia. The protection and restoration of global wetlands can be carried out in five aspects, including management and policy, monitoring, restoration, knowledge, and funding.","

"In Taiwan, immigrant workers play an important role in fisheries but they are easily ignored by society. The health problems and associated characteristics of immigrant workers in fisheries remain unclear. Descriptive and retrospective analyses were performed. Outpatient data were collected from a primary care clinic for six fishing villages in North Eastern Taiwan between 1 August 2016 and 31 July 2017. The data of immigrant workers was recorded and compared with that of natives. A total of 241 immigrant workers and 1342 natives were enrolled. Compared with the natives, the immigrant workers had a significantly younger age, male predominance, and fewer mean visits per year. The immigrant worker's visits tended to be more highly focused during the third quarter of the year. Immigrant workers paid more registration fees and self-payment, but they paid less on diagnosis fees, oral medication, laboratory exams and had reduced total costs. The top five diagnoses for immigrant workers were respiratory diseases (38.3%), trauma (15.2%), musculoskeletal diseases (11.2%), skin-related diseases (9.5%), and digestive diseases (9.1%). Immigrant workers were positively correlated with infectious/parasitic diseases, and negatively correlated with medical consults and endocrine/metabolic diseases. Immigrant workers were also positively associated with registration fees and self-payment, but negatively correlated with diagnosis fees and total costs (all p < 0.05). The distribution of skin diseases and trauma were affected by age and sex as opposed to ethnic group. Immigrant status' health issues should be given more attention.","

By 2026, Taiwan will become a super-aged society with at least 20 percent of the population in this category and 180,000 new older adults joining this population annually. The consequences of oropharyngeal physiological degradation include dysphagia, malnutrition, and a negative impact on quality of life. The provision of texture-modified foods and thickened liquids assist users with chewing or swallowing disorders, making foods easier to ingest and improving diet safety. The classification of texture modified foods allows for consistent communication among health professionals, care providers, and industry partners to improve quality of care for users. This article reviews the four texture-modified food classification systems currently in use internationally. 1. International Standardization Committee for Dysphagia: 22 countries implemented this framework, which was developed by a wide range of professions, including nutrition & dietetics, medicine, speech pathology, occupational therapy, nursing, food science & technology. This framework provides internationally standardized terminology and definitions for texture-modified foods and thickened liquids for persons with dysphagia. 2. Japanese Universal Design Foods: This voluntary standard established by the food industry addresses the physical properties related to the texture of food. The four categories in this standard are distinguished based on the hardness and viscosity of food. The category-based terms and the universal design foods logo are displayed on foods to facilitate consumer selection. 3. The smile care food-The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries reclassified nursing care food into the following three categories: (i) Food for people without eating problems but with nutrition supplement needs; (ii) Food for people with problems with swallowing functions; and (iii) Food for people with problems with chewing functions. 4.

"Aquaculture systems are highly complex, dynamic and interconnected systems influenced by environmental, biological, cultural, socio-economic and human behavioural factors. Intensification of aquaculture production is likely to drive indiscriminate use of antibiotics to treat or prevent disease and increase productivity, often to compensate for management and husbandry deficiencies. Surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic usage (ABU) and antibiotic resistance (ABR) is often lacking or absent. Consequently, there are knowledge gaps for the risk of ABR emergence and human exposure to ABR in these systems and the wider environment. The aim of this study was to use a systems-thinking approach to map two aquaculture systems in Vietnam - striped catfish and white-leg shrimp - to identify hotspots for emergence and selection of resistance, and human exposure to antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. System mapping was conducted by stakeholders at an interdisciplinary workshop in Hanoi, Vietnam during January 2018, and the maps generated were refined until consensus. Thereafter, literature was reviewed to complement and cross-reference information and to validate the final maps. The maps and component interactions with the environment revealed the grow-out phase, where juveniles are cultured to harvest size, to be a key hotspot for emergence of ABR in both systems due to direct and indirect ABU, exposure to water contaminated with antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and duration of this stage. The pathways for human exposure to antibiotics and ABR were characterised as: occupational (on-farm and at different handling points along the value chain), through consumption (bacterial contamination and residues) and by environmental routes. By using systems thinking and mapping by stakeholders to identify hotspots we demonstrate the applicability of an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to characterising ABU in aquaculture. This work provides a foundation to quantify risks at different points, understand interactions between components, and identify stakeholders who can lead and implement change.","

Postdoc professional development, however, remains rooted in outdated realities. We propose enhancements to postdoc-centred policies and practices to better align this career stage with contemporary job markets and work life. By facilitating productivity, wellness and career advancement, the proposed changes will benefit all stakeholders in postdoc success-including research teams, institutions, professional societies and the scientific community as a whole. To catalyse reform, we outline recommendations for (1) skills-based training tailored to the current career landscape, and (2) supportive policies and tools outlined in postdoc handbooks. We also invite the ecology and evolution community to lead further progressive reform.",,"

      We analyzed cross-sectional data from 18,700 persons (8,690 men, 10,010 women) aged 15-49 years, living in agrarian, trading and fishing communities and participating in the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) between March 2015 and September 2016. Logistic regression models assessed associations between past year alcohol use and sociodemographic characteristics, other drug use and HIV status, controlling for age, religion, education, occupation, marital status, and household socioeconomic status.

      Past year alcohol prevalence was 45%. Odds of drinking were significantly higher in men (versus women) and fishing communities (versus agrarian areas). Odds of drinking increased with age, previous (versus current) marriage and past year drug use. By occupation, highest odds of drinking were among fishermen and (in women) bar/restaurant workers. Alcohol-related consequences were more commonly reported by male (vs. females) drinkers, among whom up to 35% reported alcohol dependence symptoms (e.g., unsteady gait). HIV status was strongly associated with alcohol use in unadjusted but not adjusted models.

"The study examines the levels of total mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) in the muscle tissue of 12 commercially important fish species (n = 717) from 48 locations in the eastern Adriatic Sea, as a function of fish species, size and habitat. Risks and benefits of fish consumption regarding Hg and Se in children (7 years) and women of reproductive age (30 years) were also evaluated. All samples but one were compliant with the European regulatory limit for Hg in fish muscle. Concentrations (μg g-1 ww) of Hg (range: 0.014-1.37) and Se (range: 0.184-1.12) and Se:Hg molar ratios in fish were associated with habitat type. Demersal species had the highest Hg and the lowest Se concentrations, while pelagic species had the lowest Hg concentrations, highest Se concentrations and Se:Hg molar ratios. All species had Se:Hg molar ratios above 1 (range: 1.4-66.9) and a selenium health benefit value (HBVSe) above zero (range: 3.3-9.3), indicating Se excess after Hg sequestration. The intake of two meals per week of small pelagic-neritic and bento-pelagic fish is estimated to be a valuable source of essential Se, and does not pose a risk from toxic Hg exposure in children and women during the vulnerable reproductive period. Due to the low Hg and favorable Se:Hg molar ratio and HBVSe index, small pelagic species offer a good risk to benefit ratio of fish consumption and could be considered an optimal choice in these sensitive subpopulations.","

      Commercial fishing is recognised as one of the most hazardous professions worldwide. In Finland, commercial fishing has some special characteristics, including fishing on ice during frozen waters, and pluriactivity of the fisher family to gain additional income. The goal of this study was to describe injury characteristics among commercial fishers in Finland during the years 1996-2015. With this information, we wish to promote creation of effective safety campaigns and interventions.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The data for this study was acquired from The Farmers' Social Insurance Institution, who handles the mandatory pension and occupational injury insurance of Finnish commercial fishers. Descriptive statistics was used to categorise and analyse the data that comprised the anonymized insurance history of 1954 insured fishers and reports on 1135 compensated injuries, 11 fatalities, and 53 occupational disease cases.

      The results show, that the injury rate of Finnish commercial fishers is high. Forty per cent of the fishing-related injuries occur aboard or when entering or leaving the vessel, while 37% happened ashore, and 11% on sea or lake ice. The most common type of incident is preceded by a slip, trip, or sway followed by a fall to lower level. The injuries result in a median disability length of 21 days. An elevated risk for Finnish (vs. Swedish) speaking, as well as for male fishers was found. The occupational diseases of the studied population were for the most part results of manual, repetitive and/or physically straining work due to e.g. hauling in fishing equipment. Due to small numbers and lack of case data, it is not possible to make any further analysis of the 11 fatalities, which were all drownings.

      Objectives: Weather is a key source of marine risk, but relationships between fishing activity, safety, and weather remain poorly understood. Critically, the fit between available marine forecast products, fish harvesters' needs, and harvester's decision-making processes has not been rigorously assessed. This paper addresses these gaps by documenting a) weather-related decision-making by harvesters, and its relationship to forecasts across multiple regions and fisheries on Canada's East coast (Newfoundland) and b) the dynamics of forecast production priorities.Methods: A multi-disciplinary, community-engaged research approach, conducted in partnership with the Newfoundland and Labrador Fish Harvesting Safety Association (NL-FHSA). Data consist of semi-structured interviews with fish harvesters and weather forecasters, focused on marine forecast production and use.Results: Results emphasize that there is a subjective ""art"" to both production and use of marine forecasts. Forecasters and harvesters share several common values regarding forecasts, but different emphases: forecasters favor some combination of accuracy, consistency, and utility, while harvesters are largely concerned with utility. Finally, harvesters' decision-making is based on nuanced and contextual interpretations of a few key hazards (winds and, to a lesser extent, waves).Conclusion: This community-engaged research has triggered experimentation with forecasts tailored to fisheries utility within Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It lays the groundwork for ongoing, mutually beneficial dialogue between forecasters and harvesters, engaging harvesters with the forecasting process while familiarizing forecasters with harvester's decision-making processes. Ongoing industry partnerships (NL-FHSA) continue to sustain momentum from this study towards further enhancing the utility of future marine forecasts for small-scale harvesters.

      Fishermen and boatmen are a population at-risk for contracting schistosomiasis due to their high frequency of water contact in endemic areas of schistosomiasis in the People's Republic of China (P. R. China). To develop specific interventions towards this population, the present study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) towards schistosomiasis of fishermen and boatmen, and to identify the risk factors associated with schistosome infection using a molecular technique in a selected area of Hunan Province in P. R. China.

Information regarding sociodemographic details and KAPs towards schistosomiasis were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Fecal samples of participants were collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the risk factors related to the positive results of PCR.

The majority of respondents had a positive attitude towards schistosomiasis prevention. However, only 6.66% (40/601) of respondents had installed a latrine on their boats, while 32.61% (196/601) of respondents defecated in the public toilets on shore. In addition, only 4.99% (30/601) respondents protected themselves while exposed to freshwater. The prevalence of schistosomiasis, as determined by PCR, among fishermen and boatmen in Yueyang County was 13.81% (83/601). Age, years of performing the current job, number of times receiving treatment, and whether they were treated in past three years were the main influencing factors of PCR results among this population.

"The existing literature have demonstrated a considerable amount of existing studies that merely interest on scientific perspectives by examining the physical environmental changes rather than conducting social-based studies that allow for the comparison of adaptation ability between mainland and island small-scale fishermen. Therefore, the current research attempts to fill this gap by investigating the adaptation level of mainland and island small-scale fishermen towards climate changes for the purpose of further identifying any significant differences regarding their adaptation aspects. The primary aim of the current research is to conduct a comparative study with the purpose of assessing the environmental change adaptation ability between the mainland and the islander small-scale fishermen. In the context of the current research, a quantitative approach was employed by selecting a total of 600 samples through several levels of cluster sampling. The instrument for the study was developed based on the 16 adaptation variables that were suggested within the adaptation framework proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The data were analysed using SPSS, whereby to achieve the study's main objective, inferential analysis which refers to the independent t test was performed to examine any possible significant difference that might exist. In regard to this matter, various significant differences between the islander and the mainland fishermen managed to be detected in 10 adaptation aspects out of the 16 adaptation variables which include the capacity to adapt to change (monetary and emotional adaptability); the level of interest in adapting to change; the ability to plan, learn, and reorganize; and attachment to occupation. Accordingly, a number of recommendations were discussed at the end of this study which is hoped to assist the involved and relevant parties in arranging better adjustment approaches for small-scale fishermen in Malaysia.","

"Fisheries play a significant role in food security, livelihood, and source of income in developing countries. Although fish are a healthy source of protein, they can also spread diseases caused by pathogenic micro-organisms they may harbor. Epidemiology of foodborne pathogens is not well studied in Ethiopia. To address this issue to some extent, a cross-sectional study with a simple random sampling approach was conducted from October 2017 to May 2018 with the objectives of to isolate and estimate the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157: H7 in fish, and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates in selected Lakes of Northern Ethiopia. All the microbial identification and isolation procedures were conducted based on ISO 6887-3:2017 recommendations. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was also performed following the standard procedure of Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion protocol. From the total 410 fish samples examined, six (1.46%) of them were found contaminated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157: H7 strain. The organism was isolated from landing sites (5/293) and local retail markets (1/75). Besides, Escherichia coli O157: H7 was isolated from filleted fish (5/214) and whole fish (1/125); however, it was not isolated from samples of ready to eat fish and working environments of restaurants. The antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that the isolates were resistant to Ampicillin and Streptomycin disks. However, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Nalidixic acid were found effective in inhibiting the growth of all of the isolates. Since pathogenic Escherichia coli strain was detected from fish, raw and undercooked fish consumption in Ethiopia may result in contracting infections. The occurrence of such pathogenic organisms in fish indicates the need for intervention by stakeholders. Supports like freezers, generators, the establishment of fish processing plants and on job training about proper fish handling practices may play a tremendous role in decreasing the level of contamination of fish in Ethiopia.","Keywords:

"Fishing is a challenging occupation, in which physical and mental health risks may be exacerbated by environmental, socio-economic and policy change. While anecdotal information suggests that compared to other groups fishers are less likely to access healthcare, the reasons for this are poorly understood. Constraints to accessing healthcare were assessed through a mixed methods approach, using a holistic framework of access. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 119 commercial fishers in Cornwall, UK, and complemented by qualitative focus groups with women from fishing communities. Health issues experienced and perceived constraints to healthcare access differed among fishers. Organisational factors and social norms were the most commonly perceived constraints, and stronger perception of these was associated with greater likelihood of leaving a health concern untreated in the past year. The findings suggest that proactive steps are needed to enhance supply and utilisation of available healthcare services, to ensure fishers' needs are met.","

Also, a comparison of the metabolome for fish from the reference site and fish from a hatchery upstream of one of the effluent-receiving estuaries indicated no differences, implying that residency for fish in the contaminated estuary resulted in major changes to the metabolome. Based on general health parameters including whole-body lipid content and condition factor, plus the availability of prey for these fish, we conclude that juvenile Chinook salmon in these contaminated estuaries may have been experiencing metabolic disruption without any overt signs of impairment. Additionally, a non-targeted analysis was performed on hatchery summer Chinook salmon from a laboratory study where fish were dosed for 32 days with feed containing 16 of the most common contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) detected in wild fish. In the laboratory experiment a relationship was observed between dose and the number of liver metabolites that were different between control and treatment fish. Laboratory fish were exposed to only 16 CECs, but are generally exposed to hundreds of these compounds in contaminated aquatic environments. These results have implications for the health of juvenile Chinook salmon and the likelihood of a successful life cycle when exposed to effluent-related chemicals.","

"Background:
        
      
      Traditional divers from the Maluku Province of Indonesia have not received formal education and training related to standard diving tools. They only become accomplished at diving generation by generation. The use of non-standard diving tools increases the risk of injury and illness. This study aimed to get an overview of the health and safety behaviours of traditional divers.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The study was qualitative, involving 15 traditional divers who used compressors for at least 1 year and who'd had decompression sickness and barotrauma as a result of diving. The data was obtained through in-depth interviews, analysed through the Colaizzi method.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The participants' diving health and safety behaviour is triggered by the perception of the risk of diving. This is supported by the reinforcing social and environmental factors leading to the form of health and safety behaviour when diving. These behaviours include diving without planning, using a compressor, and making ""sesajen"" (kind of food, leaves, and water that are believed to be a form of surrender to the creator) which is an offering or present to the gods or ancestors. This behaviour causes complaints such as trauma and an increased economic burden. Some participants consider complaints as a threat and plan to stop diving. The participants made a plan before dive and declared that they would change their behaviour to ensure safety.

      Health and safety behaviour related to diving must be socialised and facilitated. The establishment of a divers' community that cares about health and safety behaviour needs to become important as a support system.","

"Overharvesting of terrestrial and marine resources may be alleviated by encouraging an alternative configuration of livelihoods, particularly in rural communities in developing countries. Typical occupations in such areas include fishing and farming, and rural households often switch livelihood activities to suit climate and economic conditions. We used a machine-learning tool, deep-belief networks (DBN), and data from surveys of a rural Philippine coastal community to examine household desire to change livelihood. This desire is affected by a variety of factors, such as income, family needs, and feelings of work satisfaction, that are interrelated in complex ways. In farming households, livelihood changes often occur to diversify resources, increase income, and lessen economic risk. The DBN, given its multilayer perceptron structure, has a capacity to model nonlinear relationships among factors while providing an acceptable degree of accuracy. Relative to a set of 34 features (e.g., education, boat ownership, and work satisfaction), we examined the binary response variables desire to change work or not to change work. The best network had a test set accuracy of 97.5%. Among the features, 7 significantly affected desire to shift work: ethnicity, work satisfaction, number of persons in a household in ill health, number of fighting cocks owned, fishing engagement, buy-and-sell revenue, and educational level. A cross-correlation matrix of these 7 features indicated households less inclined to change work were those engaged in fishing and retail buying and selling. For fishing, provision of economic and other incentives should be considered to encourage changing from this occupation to allow recovery of fishery resources.","

"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that detect a wide variety of microbial pathogens for the initiation of host defense immunological responses. Thirteen TLRs have been identified in mammals, and teleosts contain 22 mammalian or non-mammalian TLRs. Of these, TLR9 and TLR21 are the cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) recognition TLRs in teleosts. TLR9 is a mammalian TLR expressed in teleost but not in the avian species. TLR21 is a non-mammalian TLR expressed in both teleost and the avian species. Synthetic CpG-ODNs are potent immunostimulants that are being studied for their application against tumors, allergies, and infectious diseases, and as a vaccine adjuvant in humans. The immunostimulatory effects of CpG-ODNs as vaccine adjuvants and their antimicrobial function in domestic animals and teleosts are also being investigated. Most of our current knowledge about the molecular basis for the immunostimulatory activity of CpG-ODNs comes from earlier studies of the interaction between CpG-ODN and TLR9. More recent studies indicate that in addition to TLR9, TLR21 is another receptor for CpG-ODN recognition in teleosts to initiate immune responses. Whether these two receptors have differential functions in mediating the immunostimulatory activity of CpG-ODN in teleost has not been well-studied. Nevertheless, the existence of two recognition TLRs suggests that the molecular basis for the immunostimulatory activity of CpG-ODN in teleosts is different and more complex than in mammals. This article reviews the current knowledge of TLR9 and TLR21 activation by CpG-ODNs. The key points that need to be considered for CpG-ODNs as immunostimulants with maximum effectiveness in activation of immune responses in teleosts are discussed. This includes the structure/activity relationship of CpG-ODN activities for TLR9 and TLR21, the structure/functional relationship of these two TLRs, and differential expression levels and tissue distributions for these two TLRs.","

"This article describes the conception, implementation, and evaluation of a wilderness medicine-based first aid class for the commercial fishing industry. Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation in the United States. Currently, commercial fishermen often only have access to basic first aid classes. Because of its focus on austere environments, hazardous conditions, and distance from definitive medical care-hallmarks of commercial fisheries-wilderness medicine offers a more appropriate approach to decreasing morbidity and mortality in the industry. A 2-d, 16-h pilot wilderness medicine course for commercial fishermen, Fishermen First Aid and Safety Training (FFAST), conducted for Dungeness crab fishermen, was effective and well received, based on pre- and postcourse knowledge, skill, and attitude surveys. FFAST has been approved by the Coast Guard and is being made more widely available to commercial fishermen in the Pacific Northwest. The FFAST program offers an example of how wilderness medicine can improve safety and emergency medical response for a wide variety of austere environments not traditionally linked to the backcountry.","

"Here, Box-Behnken design (BBD) approaches were utilised to optimise synthesis methodology for the chitosan-calcite rich adsorbent (CCM) made from fishery-food waste material (crab carapace), using low-temperature activation and potassium hydroxide (KOH). The effect of activation temperature, activation time and impregnation ratio was studied. The final adsorbent material was evaluated for its phosphorus (P) removal efficiency from liquid phase. Results showed that impregnation ratio was the most significant individual factor as this acted to increase surface deacetylation of the chitin (to chitosan) and increased the number of amine groups (-NH2) in the chitosan chain. P removal efficiency approached 75.89% (at initial P concentration of 20 mg/L) under optimised experimental conditions, i.e. where the impregnation ratio for KOH:carapace (g/g) was 1:1, the activation temperature was 105 °C and the activation time was 150 min. Predicted responses were in good agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the pristine and CCM material were further analysed using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Characterisation showed enhancements in surface chemistry (introducing positively charged amine groups), textural properties and thermal stability of the CCM.","

"Objectives: Non-fatal injuries in the high risk US Dungeness crab fishery have been under-documented, despite their potential for lost work time and income, long-term disability, and early unwanted retirement. The Fishermen Led Injury Prevention Program (FLIPP) characterized injuries in this fishery, in order to identify work hazards and inform injury control measures.Methods: The FLIPP injury survey was completed by 426 fishermen in 23 Washington, Oregon, and California fishing ports prior to the 2015-2016 Dungeness crab season; 413 (97%) provided injury information for this analysis. Participants indicated whether they had been injured in the previous 12 months, described the injury, any treatments received, and whether the injury limited their ability to work.Results: Participants were mostly male (98%), more than half (56.6%) worked as deckhands, and reported considerable fishing experience (median = 14 years, interquartile range 5-27). Eighty-nine fishermen (21.5%) reported an injury incident in the past year, of which 49 (55.1%) were limiting. The 89 incidents yielded 102 injuries, of which nearly two-thirds were sprains/strains (23, 22.5%), surface wounds/bruises (17, 15.0%), cuts (18, 17.6%), or punctures (11, 10.8%). More severe injuries, including eight fractures, were rare. The majority of injuries received either no treatment (27, 26.5%) or first aid (35, 34.3%); clinical care was less common (22, 21.6%), and emergency care rare (3, 2.9%).Conclusion: One in five Dungeness crab fishermen reported an injury incident in the previous year. Most injuries were not severe and did not result in clinical care, but approximately half were work-limiting. Control measures must account for the remote and resource-limited workplace in commercial fishing.","

"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical parasitic disease caused by different species of genus Schistosoma. Schistosoma mansoni causes a severe intestinal parasitic infection of high public and medical importance in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, S. mansoni infection among the fishermen of Lake Hawassa, southern Ethiopia, using a cross-sectional study design. A total of 243 fishermen were selected from the Hawassa Town Fishermen Association's list in 2013. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors were collected from the fishermen using semi-structured questionnaires. Stool samples were collected and processed using the Kato-Katz thick smear technique. The overall prevalence of S. mansoni among the fishermen was 29.21% and the mean intensity of infection was 158.88 eggs per gram (EPG). The overall prevalence of intestinal helminths, including S. mansoni, was 69.54%. Similar prevalences of S. mansoni were recorded in age groups 15-19, 20-24 and 25-29 years: 31.82%, 31.75% and 31.94%, respectively. Fishermen who swam a minimum of once a week in Lake Hawassa were 2.92 times (95% CI: 1.554, 5.502) more likely to have acquired S. mansoni infection than those who swam in the lake less than once a week. The results indicate moderate endemicity of S. mansoni infection among the fishermen of Lake Hawassa. These fishermen could be a potentially high-risk group for S. mansoni infection and might be responsible for the transmission of infection to other segments of the community visiting the lake for recreation. Moreover, a high prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) was recorded among the fishermen. Integrated prevention and control strategies for schistosomiasis and STHs by different sectors are needed to tackle this problem.","

          Background:
        
      
      During a period of rapid growth in our understanding of the microbiology of the built environment in recent years, the majority of research has focused on bacteria and fungi. Viruses, while probably as numerous, have received less attention. In response, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation supported a workshop entitled ""Viruses in the Built Environment (VIBE),"" at which experts in environmental engineering, environmental microbiology, epidemiology, infection prevention, fluid dynamics, occupational health, metagenomics, and virology convened to synthesize recent advances and identify key research questions and knowledge gaps regarding viruses in the built environment.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Four primary research areas and funding priorities were identified. First, a better understanding of viral communities in the built environment is needed, specifically which viruses are present and their sources, spatial and temporal dynamics, and interactions with bacteria. Second, more information is needed about viruses and health, including viral transmission in the built environment, the relationship between virus detection and exposure, and the definition of a healthy virome. The third research priority is to identify and evaluate interventions for controlling viruses and the virome in the built environment. This encompasses interactions among viruses, buildings, and occupants. Finally, to overcome the challenge of working with viruses, workshop participants emphasized that improved sampling methods, laboratory techniques, and bioinformatics approaches are needed to advance understanding of viruses in the built environment.

      We hope that identifying these key questions and knowledge gaps will engage other investigators and funding agencies to spur future research on the highly interdisciplinary topic of viruses in the built environment.

"Objectives This review aimed to quantify suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and study potential variations of risk within this population. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis from 1995 to 2016 using MEDLINE and following the PRISMA guidelines. A pooled effect size of suicide risk among the population of interest was calculated using meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate whether effect size differed according to population or study characteristics. Meta-regression was used to identify sources of heterogeneity. Results The systematic review identified 65 studies, of which 32 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect size was 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.68] representing an excess of suicide risk among the population of interest. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect size varied according to geographic area, with a higher effect size in Japan. The following study characteristics were found to contribute to the between-study variance: reference group, measure of effect size, and study design. Conclusions Our findings suggest an excess of suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and demonstrated that this excess may be even higher for these groups in Japan. This review highlights the need for suicide prevention policies focusing on this specific population of workers. More research is also needed to better understand the underlying factors that may increase suicide risk in this population.",,"

"Introduction:
        
      
      Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by a diverse pathogenic leptospira species and serovars. The disease is transmitted directly following contact with infected urine and other body fluids or indirectly after contact with water or soil contaminated with infected urine.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Objectives:
        
      
      While a wide range of domestic and wild animals are known to be reservoirs of the disease, occupation, international travel and recreation are beginning to assume a center stage in the transmission of the disease. The objective of this study is to review available literatures to determine the extent to which these aforementioned risk factors aid the transmission, increase incidence and outbreak of leptospirosis in Malaysia.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Study design:
        
      
      The review was conducted based on prevalence, incidence, and outbreak cases of leptospirosis among human and susceptible animals predisposed to several of the risk factors identified in Malaysia.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Literature searchers and reviews were conducted based on articles published in citation index journals, Malaysian ministry of health reports, periodicals as well as reliable newspapers articles and online media platforms. In each case, the newspapers and online media reports were supported by press briefings by officials of the ministry of health and other agencies responsible.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      The disease is endemic in Malaysia, and this was attributed to the large number of reservoir animals, suitable humid and moist environment for proliferation as well as abundant forest resources. Over 30 different serovars have been detected in Malaysia in different domestic and wild animal species. This, in addition to the frequency of flooding which has increased in recent years, and has helped increase the risk of human exposure. Occupation, recreation, flooding and rodent population were all identified as an important source and cause of the disease within the study population.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is an urgent need for the government and other stakeholders to intensify efforts to control the spread of the disease, especially as it greatly affect human health and the tourism industry which is an important component of the Malaysian economy. The risk of infection can be minimized by creating awareness on the source and mode of transmission of the disease, including the use of protective clothing and avoiding swimming in contaminated waters. Moreover, improved diagnostics can also help reduce the suffering and mortalities that follow infection after exposure to infection source.","

"In fisheries, the tragedy of the commons manifests as a competitive race to fish that compresses fishing seasons, resulting in ecological damage, economic waste, and occupational hazards. Catch shares are hypothesized to halt the race by securing each individual's right to a portion of the total catch, but there is evidence for this from selected examples only. Here we systematically analyse natural experiments to test whether catch shares reduce racing in 39 US fisheries. We compare each fishery treated with catch shares to an individually matched control before and after the policy change. We estimate an average policy treatment effect in a pooled model and in a meta-analysis that combines separate estimates for each treatment-control pair.

          Background:
        
      
      Anthrax is globally recognized as an important public health and economic challenge in many agricultural communities. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three subcounties in Arua district to assess the community's awareness, cultural norm, and practices regarding anthrax. This followed a report of active cases of human cutaneous anthrax in the district.

          Results:
        
      
      The affected communities had limited knowledge about anthrax, especially its clinical manifestation and modes of transmission both in humans and animals. The community also had no knowledge of the anthrax vaccine or treatment and where they can be accessed from. Poor practices associated with anthrax outbreaks included poor disposal of carcasses and ruminal wastes, occupational hazards (butchers, slaughter men, and herdsmen), consumption of meat from infected animals, communal herding, and cultural norms encouraging consumption of dead animals.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study shows that there is a knowledge gap about anthrax among the people in the affected communities. Key drivers for the anthrax outbreak such as poor cultural beliefs and practices and wildlife-livestock-human interactions were observed in all the three subcounties studied. All these findings could imply a high risk of outbreak of anthrax in Arua and Ugandan agricultural communities where the public health programs are less standardized and less effective.

"We assessed the risk of fatal occupational injuries among migrant workers with two different types of employment permits in South Korea. This observational study used national data from January 2007 to September 2018 and analyzed 42,089 cases of occupationally injured migrant workers of Chinese nationality. Fatality rates were analyzed according to year, sex, age, occupation, industry, and type of employment permit. Chinese workers were permitted to work for one employer and prohibited from changing employers, whereas Korean-Chinese workers were permitted to change their employer. The adjusted fatality rate of occupational injuries of Chinese migrant workers was significantly higher (1.80-fold, 95% confidence interval 1.31-2.46) than that of Korean-Chinese migrant workers. The prohibition on changing workplaces; male sex; age ≥ 45 years; machine operator; construction industry; and agriculture, livestock, and fisheries industry were risk factors for fatal occupational injuries. The results imply a need for revision of the migrant-worker employment permit systems and implementation of occupational safety and health policies for all workers to promote health equity.","

The purpose of the current study was the risk assessment of upper limb-WMSDs of workers engaged in tasks of anchovies filleting and packaging in a fish industry considering the ergonomic evaluation and the painful symptomatology complained by employees of different age. The activities were analysed by the American Conference Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) method, the Strain Index (SI) method, the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method as well as the Occupational Rapid Assessment (OCRA) checklist. Workers answered the Italian version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ).

The final score identified by RULA, for tasks of fish filleting and packaging, suggested a medium level of action, therefore were required additional observations. By OCRA checklist the final score for both tasks denoted a high risk.

"Background:
        
      
      Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease of worldwide importance, though relatively neglected in many African countries including sub Saharan Africa that is among areas with high burden of this disease. The disease is often mistaken for other febrile illnesses such as dengue, malaria, rickettsioses and enteric fever. Leptospirosis is an occupational disease likely to affect people working in environments prone to infestation with rodents which are the primary reservoir hosts of this disease. Some of the populations at risk include: sugarcane plantation workers, wetland farmers, fishermen and abattoir workers. In this study we investigated the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira among sugarcane plantation and factory workers, fishing communities as well as among rodents and shrews in domestic and peridomestic environments within the study areas.

Blood was collected from consenting human adults, and from rodents and shrews (insectivores) captured live using Sherman traps. Serological detection of leptospiral antibodies in blood serum was carried out by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

However, the prevalent gender inequality in terms of task allocation, wages, and other welfare facilities makes the men as dominant workforce. Furthermore, there are occasions when incidents of workplace violence take place. The present study was conducted to find the prevalence of workplace violence at worksite and study gender bias in such events. In a cross-sectional study 171 fishermen and fisherwomen were interviewed to collect information about workplace violence. The overall prevalence of workplace violence reported was 14.6%. This included 2 (8%) cases of physical assault, 1 (4%) case of sexual harassment of fisherwoman by her colleague and 22 (88%) cases of verbal abuse. A significant (p=0.002) association was found between gender and verbal abuse at the workplace. In conclusion, this study highlighted the occurrence of workplace violence among fishery workers in India.

"Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) has been an important source of income for communities in the Madre de Dios River Basin in Peru for hundreds of years. However, in recent decades, the scale of ASGM activities in the region has increased dramatically, and exposures to a variety of occupational and environmental hazards related to ASGM, including mercury, are becoming more widespread. The aims of our study were to: (1) examine patterns in the total hair mercury level of human participants in several communities in the region and compare these results to the 2.2 µg/g total hair mercury level equivalent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee of Food Additives (JECFA)'s Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI); and (2), to measure the mercury levels of paco (Piaractus brachypomus) fish raised in local aquaculture ponds, in order to compare these levels to the EPA Fish Tissue Residue Criterion of 0.3 µg Hg/g fish (wet weight). We collected hair samples from 80 participants in four communities (one control and three where ASGM activities occurred) in the region, and collected 111 samples from fish raised in 24 local aquaculture farms. We then analyzed the samples for total mercury. Total mercury levels in hair were statistically significantly higher in the mining communities than in the control community, and increased with increasing geodesic distance from the Madre de Dios headwaters, did not differ by sex, and frequently exceeded the reference level. Regression analyses indicated that higher hair mercury levels were associated with residence in ASGM communities. The analysis of paco fish samples found no samples that exceeded the EPA tissue residue criterion. Collectively, these results align with other recent studies showing that ASGM activities are associated with elevated human mercury exposure. The fish farmed through the relatively new process of aquaculture in ASGM areas appeared to have little potential to contribute to human mercury exposure. More research is needed on human health risks associated with ASGM to discern occupational, residential, and nutritional exposure, especially through tracking temporal changes in mercury levels as fish ponds age, and assessing levels in different farmed fish species. Additionally, research is needed to definitively determine that elevated mercury levels in humans and fish result from the elemental mercury from mining, rather than from a different source, such as the mercury released from soil erosion during deforestation events from mining or other activities.","

"Objectives: In Norwegian aquaculture, safer technology and better safety management systems have been developed during the last decade. Safety commitment and safe behavior are still vital to ensure a safe working environment. The objective of this paper is to explore what factors might influence the reporting of hazardous situations in aquaculture. The significance of factors on both the individual (work experience, position) and company/organizational level (company size, safety climate) was studied. It was hypothesized that reporting of hazardous situations was positively predicted by work experience, having the position as operational manager, company size, and safety climate.Methods: The study is based on a quantitative questionnaire study involving 428 fish farmers, operational managers, and service vessel employees in the Norwegian aquaculture industry, interviewed by telephone. A purposive sampling procedure was employed. Correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were applied. The data quality was considered satisfactory.Results: Individual factors had no significant relationship with the reporting of hazardous situations. Company size and safety climate factors had positive associations with reporting. Larger companies might have more resources for safety management and the development of practical reporting solutions. A positive safety climate might increase the motivation for reporting.Conclusion: Efforts by management to improve the safety climate can contribute to the reporting of hazardous events, continuous improvement of safety management and improvement of the safety level.","

"Background: In this study, we focused on three zoonotic brucellosis risk groups; abattoir workers, febrile cases at Wau hospital and cattle herders, in Bahr el Ghazal region, South Sudan. Competitive c-ELISA was used to detect anti-Brucella antibodies in 725 individuals between December 2015 and May 2016. In addition, questionnaire metadata, focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to characterize the epidemiology of zoonotic brucellosis in this region. Results: Overall, we estimate 27.2 % (95% CI = 23.9-30.6) brucellosis sero-prevalence; 32.1% (95% CI = 26.2-38.4), 23.0% (95% CI = 19.1-27.4) and 34.6% (95% CI = 24.4-46.3) among abattoir workers, febrile cases, and herders, respectively. Marital status (Single, OR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.36-0.91, P = 0.02) and ethnicity (Kerash OR = 6.01, 95%CI: 1.97-21.10, P = 0.003 and Balanda, OR = 3.78, 95%CI: 1.42-12.02, P = 0.01) were associated with brucellosis. While gender and ethnicity were important factors for general awareness of zoonotic diseases. Highly ranked occupations at risk included veterinarian, butchers and milk handlers. We also identified covariate patterns for clinical diagnostics and public health interventions. Conclusion: We report the highest sero-prevalence of zoonotic brucellosis in three risk groups in the East African region. All this is not only occurring in a population with limited awareness that brucellosis is a zoonotic disease but also where one in nine health workers tested was sero-positive. We identified social demographic associations with brucellosis, however, the qualitative analysis suggests these are more complex and nuanced. Therefore, future studies could benefit from the use of the mixed methods approach to add extensiveness and depth to our understanding of zoonotic disease drivers, in order to implement mitigating measures such as cattle vaccination.","

"Brucellosis is an endemic zoonosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Pastoralists are at high risk of infection but data on brucellosis from these communities are scarce. The study objectives were to: estimate the prevalence of human brucellosis, identify the Brucella spp. causing illness, describe non-Brucella bloodstream infections, and identify risk factors for brucellosis in febrile patients from a pastoralist community of Tanzania. Fourteen (6.1%) of 230 participants enrolled between August 2016 and October 2017 met study criteria for confirmed (febrile illness and culture positivity or ≥four-fold rise in SAT titre) or probable (febrile illness and single SAT titre ≥160) brucellosis. Brucella spp. was the most common bloodstream infection, with B. melitensis isolated from seven participants and B. abortus from one. Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated. Risk factors identified for brucellosis included age and herding, with a greater probability of brucellosis in individuals with lower age and who herded cattle, sheep or goats in the previous 12 months. Disease prevention activities targeting young herders have potential to reduce the impacts of human brucellosis in Tanzania. Livestock vaccination strategies for the region should include both B. melitensis and B. abortus.",,"

"We undertook the first study systematically evaluating the risk of Anisakis-sensitization in Croatian fish-processing workers and potential genetic susceptibility to anisakiasis. Anti-Anisakis IgE seroprevalence and risk factors for 600 employees of Croatian fish processing facilities and 466 blood donor controls, were assessed by indirect ELISA targeted with: recombinant Ani s 1 and Ani s 7 allergens, an Anisakis crude extract, the commercial ImmunoCAP kit, and questionnaires. Genetic susceptibility to anisakiasis was evaluated by genotypisation of human leukocytes alleles (HLA). Anti-Anisakis seropositive and a fraction of negative subjects were also assessed by ELISA and Western Blot (WB) for IgG seroprevalence to Trichinella spp. Overall, the observed anti-Anisakis seroprevalence inferred by indirect ELISA was significantly higher in fish processing workers (1.8%, 95% CI 0.9-3.3%) compared to the controls (0%, 0-0.8%). Seven out of 11 Ani s 1 and Ani s 7-positives and none of selected 65 negative sera, tested positive on whole-Anisakis extract (ImmunoCAP), whereas Anisakis crude extract ELISA detected 3.9% (2.4-6.0%) seropositives in fish processing workers, three (14%) of which showed IgE reactivity to milk proteins. The highest risk associated with Anisakis-sensitization among workers was fishing in the free time, rather than any of attributes related to the occupational exposure. Although no association was observed between anti-Anisakis seropositivity and wearing gloves or protective goggles, the majority of workers (92%) wore protective gloves, minimizing the risk for Anisakis sensitization via skin contact. Six HLA alleles within DRB1 gene were significantly associated with seropositivity under dominant, allelic or recessive models. All sera confirmed negative for anti-Trichinella spp. IgG. The study exhaustively covered almost all marine fish processing workers in Croatia, reflecting real-time Anisakis sensitization status within the industry, already under the influence of wide array of allergens.",,"

"This paper is focussed on the analysis of development outcomes of Fadama III programme among fish farmers in Nigeria with evidence from Lagos state. Random sampling technique was used to select 141 fish farmers from the Fadama III participants and non-participants from three agricultural divisions. Data were collected through structured questionnaire and analysed using descriptive statistics. While propensity score matching approach was employed to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) using productivity level as an outcome, double-difference approach and Gini coefficient were used to estimate the project's impact on the income of the beneficiaries. The double difference estimator showed that the fish farmers who participated in Fadama III programme had 62.4% increase in their income. Education level, income level before the programme and land ownership were factors that positively influenced the probability of participating in Fadama III. The ATT estimates showed that the intervention/programme had a positive impact on the production level of participants to the tune of 2.15 tonnes per year. The Gini coefficient also showed that the fish farmers were better-off as their Gini-index reduced from 0.755 to 0.489 after participation in Fadama III. Fish farming was found to be generally profitable in the study area with a net profit of ₦7.36 million per annum while the Benefit Cost (B/C) ratio was 3.95. The income of fish farmers, after participation in Fadama III project, was positively and significantly influenced by the occupation and income of the farmers before participation in the project. The beneficiaries/participants surpassed the target of 40% increase in income set for the project. The beneficiaries were therefore better-off after participating in the programme. It is recommended that other farmers having no access to large income should be encouraged to participate and be a part of the ongoing Fadama III additional financing initiative.","

All fishermen were in the fifties; the third one never smoked while the other two were described as heavy smokers.

"This study examined occupational noise within two rearing facilities at a production fish hatchery and evaluated two simple noise reduction techniques. Ambient noise levels in the hatchery tank room ranged from 50 dB in the absence of flowing water to over 73 dB when water was flowing to all 35 tanks under typical hatchery operating procedures. Covering the open standpipes did not significantly reduce noise levels. However, placing partial tank covers over the top of the tanks above the water inlet significantly reduced noise levels, both with and without the use of standpipe covers. Noise levels in the salmon building rose from 43.2 dB without any flowing water to 77.5 dB with water flowing to all six in-ground tanks. Significant noise reductions were observed when the tanks were completely covered or with standpipe covers. Decibel levels showed the greatest reduction when the tanks and standpipes were both covered. These results indicate that occupational noise levels in aquaculture environments may be reduced through the use of simple and relatively inexpensive techniques.",,"

A self-perceived vision difficulty indicator was derived from responses to 3 separate measures. Those indicating farming, forestry, or fishing as longest job worked were classified as having an FFF history and compared to those reporting any other occupation. Logistic regression analyses utilizing NHANES sampling weights were conducted. After controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income-to-poverty ratio, those with an FFF history were 76% more likely to report vision difficulty than those having an alternate occupational history.

      Pakistan is being hit by communicable and noncommunicable diseases over time. Among these, tickborne viral disease, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is one of the most fatal infections. Rapid climate change aroused by industrial, occupational, and agricultural activities to support ever-growing human population has been considered the single most causative basis for emergence or re-emergence of CCHF in Pakistan, where it has biannual peaks between the months of March-May and August-October. Many factors, including poor sanitation at farms, villages, and cities, unhygienic transportation and slaughter of animals at numerous sites within a city, inefficient tick-control programs, post-slaughter piles of animal remains other than meat, nomadic lifestyle, and lack of trained animal and human healthcare staff, are contributing to the spread of CCHF. Pakistan has confirmed cases of CCHF in almost every province: Sindh (Karachi), Punjab (Faisalabad, Multan, and Rawalpindi), Balochistan (Quetta) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar). The root cause behind the spread of CCHF in Pakistan seems to be the absence of an effective disease surveillance system in the human as well as the animal populations. Most of the time, CCHF cases are not diagnosed, and if they are diagnosed they are not reported. If these cases are reported, there are not enough effective measures by the relevant provincial and district authorities. There is a need to educate the general public, farmers, and healthcare workers about the causes, transmission, and dangers of CCHF. An immediate plan for the implementation of a surveillance system, standard preventive measures, early detection, proper treatment, and timely response is urgently needed. Without such a plan, the accumulation of factors responsible for the sudden outbreak of CCHF may pose a serious threat to humans and animals in different geographical regions of the country.

Sinking vessels cause the most fatalities in the industry; however, falling from a fishing vessel is a serious hazard responsible for the second highest number of commercial fishing-associated fatalities (2,3). CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analyzed data on unintentional fatal falls overboard in the U.S. commercial fishing industry to identify gaps in the use of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies. During 2000-2016, a total of 204 commercial fishermen died after unintentionally falling overboard. The majority of falls (121; 59.3%) were not witnessed, and 108 (89.3%) of these victims were not found. Among 83 witnessed falls overboard, 56 rescue attempts were made; 22 victims were recovered but were not successfully resuscitated. The circumstances, rescue attempts, and limited use of lifesaving and recovery equipment indicate that efforts to reduce these preventable fatalities are needed during pre-event, event, and post-event sequences of falls overboard. Vessel owners could consider strategies to prevent future fatalities, including lifeline tethers, line management, personal flotation devices (PFDs), man-overboard alarms, recovery devices, and rescue training.",,"Fatal Falls Overboard in Commercial Fishing - United States, 2000-2016",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29698380/
"Fishermen in Southeast Asia have been found to be highly vulnerable to HIV, with research evidence highlighting the role of sexual risk behaviors. This study aims to estimate the rate of HIV as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among Malaysian fishermen, and the risky sexual and injection drug use behaviors that may contribute to these infections. The study also includes an assessment of socio-demographic, occupational and behavioral correlates of testing positive for HIV or HCV, and socio-demographic and occupational correlates of risk behaviors. The study had a cross-sectional design and recruited 406 fishermen through respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Participants self-completed a questionnaire and provided biological specimens for HIV and HCV testing. We conducted and compared results of analyses of both unweighted data and data weighted with the Respondent-Driven Sampling Analysis Tool (RDSAT). Of the participating fishermen, 12.4% were HIV positive and 48.6% had HCV infection. Contrary to expectations and findings from previous research, most fishermen (77.1%) were not sexually active. More than a third had a history of injection drug use, which often occurred during fishing trips on commercial vessels and during longer stays at sea. Of the fishermen who injected drugs, 42.5% reported unsafe injection practices in the past month. Reporting a history of injection drug use increased the odds of testing HIV positive by more than 6 times (AOR = 6.22, 95% CIs [2.74, 14.13]). Most fishermen who injected drugs tested positive for HCV. HCV infection was significantly associated with injection drug use, being older than 25 years, working on a commercial vessel and spending four or more days at sea per fishing trip. There is an urgent need to strengthen current harm reduction and drug treatment programs for Malaysian fishermen who inject drugs, especially among fishermen who work on commercial vessels and engage in deep-sea fishing.",,"

To achieve this goal, we have organized a proficiency test focused on the bioinformatics components for the generation of complete genome sequences of salmonid rhabdoviruses.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Three partners, that performed virus sequencing using different commercial library preparation kits and NGS platforms, gathered together and shared with each other 75 raw datasets which were analyzed separately by the participants to produce a consensus sequence according to their own bioinformatics pipeline. Results were then compared to highlight discrepancies, and a subset of inconsistencies were investigated more in detail.

      In total, we observed 526 discrepancies, of which 39.5% were located at genome termini, 14.1% at intergenic regions and 46.4% at coding regions. Among these, 10 SNPs and 99 indels caused changes in the protein products. Overall reproducibility was 99.94%. Based on the analysis of a subset of inconsistencies investigated more in-depth, manual curation appeared the most critical step affecting sequence comparability, suggesting that the harmonization of this phase is crucial to obtain comparable results. The analysis of a calibrator sample allowed assessing BI accuracy, being 99.983%.

"Predators exert strong effects on ecological communities, particularly when they re-occupy areas after decades of extirpation. Within species, such effects can vary over time and by sex and cascade across trophic levels. We used a space-for-time substitution to make foraging observations of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) across a gradient of reoccupation time (1-30 years), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis to ask whether (a) sea otter niche space varies as a function of occupation time and (b) whether niche space varies by sex. We found that niche space varied among areas of different occupation times. Dietary niches at short occupation times were dominated by urchins (Mesocentrotus and Strongylocentrotus spp; >60% of diets) in open habitats at 10-40 m depths. At longer occupation times, niches were dominated by small clams (Veneroida; >30% diet), mussels (Mytilus spp; >20% diet), and crab (Decapoda; >10% diet) in shallow (<10 m) kelp habitats. Diet diversity was lowest (H' = 1.46) but energy rich (~37 kcal/min) at the earliest occupied area and highest, but energy poor (H' = 2.63, ~9 kcal/min) at the longest occupied area. A similar transition occurred through time at a recently occupied area. We found that niche space also differed between sexes, with bachelor males consuming large clams (>60%), and urchins (~25%) from deep waters (>40 m), and females and territorial males consuming smaller, varied prey from shallow waters (<10 m). Bachelor male diets were less diverse (H' = 2.21) but more energy rich (~27 kcal/min) than territorial males (H' = 2.54, ~13 kcal/min) and females (H' = 2.74, ~11 kcal/min). Given recovering predators require adequate food and space, and the ecological interactions they elicit, we emphasize the importance of investigating niche space over the duration of recovery and considering sex-based differences in these interactions.","

"Broiler chicken welfare is under increasing scrutiny due to welfare concerns regarding growth rate and stocking density. This farm-based study explored broiler welfare in four conditions representing commercial systems varying in breed and planned maximum stocking density: (1) Breed A, 30 kg/m2; (2) Breed B, 30 kg/m2; (3) Breed B, 34 kg/m2; (4) Breed C, 34 kg/m2. Breeds A and B were 'slow-growing' breeds (< 50 g/day), and Breed C was a widely used 'fast-growing' breed. Indicators of negative welfare, behavioural indicators of positive welfare and environmental outcomes were assessed. Clear differences between conditions were detected. Birds in Condition 4 experienced the poorest health (highest mortality and post-mortem inspection rejections, poorest walking ability, most hock burn and pododermatitis) and litter quality. These birds also displayed lower levels of behaviours indicative of positive welfare (enrichment bale occupation, qualitative 'happy/active' scores, play, ground-scratching) than birds in Conditions 1-3. These findings provide farm-based evidence that significant welfare improvement can be achieved by utilising slow-growing breeds. There are suggested welfare benefits of a slightly lower planned maximum stocking density for Breed B and further health benefits of the slowest-growing breed, although these interventions do not offer the same magnitude of welfare improvement as moving away from fast-growing broilers.",,"

"Estuaries around the world are in a state of decline following decades or more of overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Oysters (Ostreidae), ecosystem engineers in many estuaries, influence water quality, construct habitat, and provide food for humans and wildlife. In North America's Chesapeake Bay, once-thriving eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations have declined dramatically, making their restoration and conservation extremely challenging. Here we present data on oyster size and human harvest from Chesapeake Bay archaeological sites spanning ∼3,500 y of Native American, colonial, and historical occupation. We compare oysters from archaeological sites with Pleistocene oyster reefs that existed before human harvest, modern oyster reefs, and other records of human oyster harvest from around the world. Native American fisheries were focused on nearshore oysters and were likely harvested at a rate that was sustainable over centuries to millennia, despite changing Holocene climatic conditions and sea-level rise. These data document resilience in oyster populations under long-term Native American harvest, sea-level rise, and climate change; provide context for managing modern oyster fisheries in the Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere around the world; and demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach that can be applied broadly to other fisheries.","

"Fisheries play a significant role in food security, livelihood, and source of income in developing countries. The annual fish production potential of Ethiopia reaches up to 51, 000 tones, however, the actual production is much less than the potential that the country has. The fisheries sector of Ethiopian is not well developed regarding pre and post-harvest handling practices. Besides, post-harvest loss in the fisheries sector is not yet well-studied. This study objective aims to assess causes and extent of post-harvest loss associated with fish in Lakes of Hayq and Tekeze. Post-harvest loss assessment was conducted using a simple random sampling approach from October 2017 to May 2018. The study was conducted based on FAO recommendations of qualitative and quantitative field assessment methods. These methods include Informal fish loss assessment method (IFLAM), load tracking (LT) and the questionnaire loss assessment method (QLAM) methods were used to assess the causes and to estimate the amount of PHL of fish. The data generated by these methods were analyzed descriptively as well as a GLM model was used to understand the causes of fish loss in the two study lakes. A total of 140 randomly selected participants were included in the interview process. From these participants, 85 of them were from lake Tekeze while the rest were from Hayq. Results indicate that high environmental temperature, absence or delayed marketing, harvesting immature fish, predators, and flood are the most important causes of post-harvest loss of fish in the two Lakes. Besides a GLM model predicted that study lake, boat type used, boat ownership, species of fish harvested, preservation method used, distance to market (Km), Maximum catch/day (Kg), Minimum catch/day (Kg), and Fishing experience were essential predictors for post-harvest loss incurred by fishermen on daily basis. Based on secondary data from agricultural office, the monetary value of the post-harvest loss of fish was estimated to be 10,934,000 Ethiopian birrs (397,600 USD) for the last six years in the study areas. A considerable product loss in the fisheries sector indicates the need for intervention by stakeholders. Provision of support services and assets such as freezers, electricity generators, boats, legal net and on job training about proper handling practices may play a tremendous role in decreasing post-harvest loss in the fisheries sector of the study areas.","

"In their meta-analysis, Klingelschmidt and her associates (1) found that agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers are at 48% higher risk of suicide than the working-age population. Moreover, they found that the excess risk is even greater among Japanese agricultural workers than workers from other high-income countries. There are several concerns regarding this meta-analysis. It appears that the excess risk has been overestimated for these workers. Furthermore, the excess risk in Japan is not different than other high-income countries. First, in a systematic review, a literature search is comprehensive. A search of a single database is unlikely to identify most of relevant studies, and these types of reviews are not therefore considered as systematic reviews (2). In this review, a specialized database (-PsycINFO) or a European database (EMBASE or -Scopus) was not searched. Second, following the PRISMA guidelines, the critical appraisal of included studies (quality assessment) is a requirement for a systematic review. In a meta-analysis of observational studies, selection bias and confounding should be ruled out. Third, the reviewers did not correctly extract confidence intervals (CI) for the estimates of several studies such as Hassler 2004, Fleming 1999, and Fragar 2011. Moreover, some studies reported both the least- and maximally adjusted risk estimates. The reviewers, however, extracted age- or the least-adjusted risk estimate. A confounder-adjusted estimate is a more appropriate estimate of the true association. In some studies [eg, Kposowa (3) Agerbo (4)], the excess risk dropped by 52-71% after adjustment for confounders. As a sensitivity analysis, the reviewers could limit their meta-analysis to a subgroup of studies controlled for confounders. Fourth, the reviewers did not estimate an overall risk estimate for each study. They included the estimates of 2-6 subgroups for 22 studies in forest and funnel plots. A fixed-effect meta-analysis is a more appropriate model to combine the subgroups of a single study. Moreover, for the assessment of publication bias, it is not appropriate to include several subsamples of a single study in a funnel plot. Using estimates of subgroups can change a large study into several smaller studies. Fifth, some of the included studies compared agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers with a specific occupational group. The reviewers could calculate a risk estimate using all other occupational groups as a comparison group and exclude those studies that did not provide sufficient data for estimating such a risk estimate. In some studies, the excess risk for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers disappears after comparing with other occupational groups [eg, adjusted risk ratios (RR) for Kposowa (3) = 1.02, 95% CI 0.41-2.54]. This is a main reason for observed higher excess risk in Japanese workers. Wada et al (5) compared Japanese agricultural workers with sales workers and Suzuki et al (6) compared Japanese agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers with production process and related workers. Using all other occupational groups as a reference group, age-adjusted RR dropped from 3.53 (95% CI 2.84-4.38) to 2.61 (95% CI 2.10-3.25) for Wada et al (5) and from 3.24 (CI 2.95-3.57, both sexes combined) to 1.31 (CI 1.27-1.35 age-adjusted OR after excluding unemployed people) for Suzuki et al (6). The pooled estimate of these two register-based studies was 1.33 (95% CI 1.29-1.37) using a fixed model and 1.83 (95% CI 0.93-3.60) using a random model. Sixth, most of the included studies used register data, which had little information on the background characteristics of the participants. A majority of these studies controlled the estimates for age and sex only. Moreover, in this review, prospective cohort studies did not support the observed association. A meta-analysis of 11 case-control and prospective cohort studies shows no significant excess risk of suicide for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (pooled estimate = 1.02, 95% CI 0.71-1.47 for 6 cohort studies and 1.13, 95% CI 0.92-1.39, I2 = 91% for 11 case control and cohort studies, combining maximally adjusted risk estimates and comparing agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers with all other occupational groups where possible). The excess risk found in this review (1) can thus largely be due to confounding. References 1.

"Biofouling is a serious problem in marine aquaculture and it has a number of negative impacts including increased forces on aquaculture structures and reduced water exchange across nets. This in turn affects the behavior of fish cages in waves and currents and has an impact on the water volume and quality inside net pens. Even though these negative effects are acknowledged by the research community and governmental institutions, there is limited knowledge about fouling related effects on the flow past nets, and more detailed investigations distinguishing between different fouling types have been called for. This study evaluates the effect of hydroids, an important fouling organism in Norwegian aquaculture, on the forces acting on net panels. Drag forces on clean and fouled nets were measured in a flume tank, and net solidity including effect of fouling were determined using image analysis. The relationship between net solidity and drag was assessed, and it was found that a solidity increase due to hydroids caused less additional drag than a similar increase caused by change in clean net parameters. For solidities tested in this study, the difference in drag force increase could be as high as 43% between fouled and clean nets with same solidity. The relationship between solidity and drag force is well described by exponential functions for clean as well as for fouled nets. A method is proposed to parameterize the effect of fouling in terms of an increase in net solidity. This allows existing numerical methods developed for clean nets to be used to model the effects of biofouling on nets. Measurements with other types of fouling can be added to build a database on effects of the accumulation of different fouling organisms on aquaculture nets.",,"

"Background:
        
      
      Fishing is an extremely dangerous occupational activity that predisposes to occupational diseases and accidents. Greece, with about 16,000 km of coastline and its unique morphological characteristics with small islands and peninsulas, represents a strong proof of its great tradition in the fisheries sector since ancient times. The aim of the study was to examine the health status and the health risk factors present in Greek fishery workers, by exploring their working environment, thus providing a current baseline for documentation of the needs for prevention and health promotion.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Materials and methods:
        
      
      An interviewer-administered questionnaire was distributed in 2013 to a random sample of 172 professional small-scale fishermen of the Evros district in North-Eastern Greece.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Eighty-eight per cent worked in coastal fisheries and 73% were using small fishing vessels, less than 10 m in length overall. Health disorders included musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and visual problems and to a minor degree by hearing, dermatologic and respiratory problems in all age groups. Seventy per cent had experienced at least one occupational accident. Heavy smoking and daily alcohol consumption was seen among nearly half of the fishermen.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The health effects observed are causally related to the work process exposures on board and to diet, smoking, and lack of exercise. This in turn relates to the specific working conditions, the culture and level of education in small-scale fishing that need to be taken into consideration together in the prevention programmes.","

      Multigene and genomic data sets have become commonplace in the field of phylogenetics, but many existing tools are not designed for such data sets, which often makes the analysis time-consuming and tedious. Here, we present PhyloSuite, a (cross-platform, open-source, stand-alone Python graphical user interface) user-friendly workflow desktop platform dedicated to streamlining molecular sequence data management and evolutionary phylogenetics studies. It uses a plugin-based system that integrates several phylogenetic and bioinformatic tools, thereby streamlining the entire procedure, from data acquisition to phylogenetic tree annotation (in combination with iTOL). It has the following features: (a) point-and-click and drag-and-drop graphical user interface; (b) a workplace to manage and organize molecular sequence data and results of analyses; (c) GenBank entry extraction and comparative statistics; and (d) a phylogenetic workflow with batch processing capability, comprising sequence alignment (mafft and macse), alignment optimization (trimAl, HmmCleaner and Gblocks), data set concatenation, best partitioning scheme and best evolutionary model selection (PartitionFinder and modelfinder), and phylogenetic inference (MrBayes and iq-tree). PhyloSuite is designed for both beginners and experienced researchers, allowing the former to quick-start their way into phylogenetic analysis, and the latter to conduct, store and manage their work in a streamlined way, and spend more time investigating scientific questions instead of wasting it on transferring files from one software program to another.

"Fishing communities are a most-at-risk population for HIV in Uganda. Alcohol use and abuse and economic vulnerability fuel risky sexual practices and lead to increased risk of HIV infection in these communities. Economic strengthening is an emerging intervention approach and interventions promoting saving money via mechanisms with a ""soft commitment"" in the form of restricting or charging small fees for withdrawals, may serve to reduce spending on alcohol and spending that leads to HIV risk behaviors in cash-based economies. However, little research has been conducted to explore the potential for commitment savings-led economic strengthening interventions to address alcohol use and sexual risk behavior among fisherfolk. This cross-sectional study explored the associations between commitment savings, HIV sexual risk behavior, and problematic alcohol among fisherfolk. We also determined whether commitment savings moderated the associations between problematic alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. 300 (132 male, 168 female) residents of fishing communities on Lake Victoria, Uganda completed a structured interviewer-assisted interview. Over half (55.3%) used commitment savings by saving money in a bank or savings cooperative or via mobile money. Having problematic alcohol use increased the rate of risky unprotected sex with: all partners (adjIRR 6.08, 95% CI 4.30-8.60) and with casual partners and CSWs/clients (adjIRR 4.90, 95% CI 3.09-7.78), and increased the odds of having met a sex partner at an alcohol venue (adjOR 2.84, 95% CI 1.46-5.51) compared to those without problematic alcohol use. Commitment savings was associated with lower odds of: problematic alcohol use (adjOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.96), meeting a sex partner at an alcohol venue (adjOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.78), as well as lower rates of risky unprotected sex with all partners (adjIRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.96), and with causal partners, CSWs/clients (adjIRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.85). Use of commitment savings moderated the associations between problematic alcohol use and unprotected sex. However, the moderating effects of commitment savings varied by gender. These findings suggest that promoting saving money in savings mechanisms which involve a commitment may be a potentially viable avenue for HIV prevention among fishing communities and may be particularly helpful for those who have problematic alcohol use.","

"Perhabdoviruses are a threat to some freshwater fish species raised in aquaculture farms in Europe. Although the genetic diversity of these viruses is suspected to be high, the classification of isolates is still in its infancy, with just one full-length genome available and only partial sequences for a limited number of others. Here, we characterized a series of viruses isolated from percids in France from 1999 to 2009 by sequencing the nucleoprotein (N) gene. Four main clusters were distinguished, all related at varying levels of similarity to one of the two already-recognized species, namely Perch perhabdovirus and Sea trout perhabdovirus. Furthermore, we obtained the complete genome of five isolates, including one belonging to Sea trout rhabdovirus. The analysis of the complete L genes and the concatenated open reading frames confirmed the existence of four main genetic clusters, sharing 69 to 74% similarity. We propose the assignation of all these viral isolates into four species, including two new ones: Perch perhabdovirus 1, Perch perhabdovirus 2, Sea trout perhabdovirus 1 and Sea trout perhabdovirus 2. In addition, we developed new primers to readily amplify specific portions of the N gene of any isolate of each species by conventional PCR. The presence of such genetically diverse viruses in France is likely due to divergent viral populations maintained in the wild and then introduced to experimental facilities or farms, as well as via trade between farms across the European continent. It is now urgent to improve the identification tools for this large group of viruses to prevent their unchecked dissemination.","

"Nickel nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) have been widely used in various industries related to electronics, ceramics, textiles, and nanomedicine. Ambient and occupational exposure to Ni-NPs may bring about potential detrimental effects on animals and humans. Thus, there is a growing effort to identify compounds that can ameliorate NPs-associated pathophysiologies. The present study examined Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia) bark extracts (CMBE) for its ameliorative activity against Ni-NPs-induced pathophysiological and histopathological alterations in male Sprague Dawley rats. The biochemical analyses revealed that dosing rats with Ni-NPs at 10 mg/kg/body weight (b.w.) significantly altered the normal structural and biochemical adaptations in the liver and kidney. Conversely, supplementations with CMBE at different doses (225, 200, and 175 mg/kg/b.w. of rat) ameliorated the altered blood biochemistry and reduced the biomarkers of liver and kidney function considerably (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. However, the best results were at 225 mg/kg/b.w. of rat. The study provided preliminary information about the protective effect of C. cassia against Ni-NPs indicated liver and kidney damages. Future investigations are needed to explore C. cassia mechanism of action and isolation of single constituents of C. cassia to assess their pharmaceutical importance accordingly.","

"Several metabolic parameters were assessed in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) residing in two estuaries receiving wastewater treatment effluent and one reference estuary. We also conducted a laboratory study with fish dosed for 32 days with 16 of the most common contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) detected in feral fish. Several blood chemistry parameters and other indicators of health were measured in fish from the field and laboratory study that were used to assess potential metabolic disruption. The blood chemistry values observed in feral juvenile Chinook salmon were relatively consistent among fish collected from effluent-impacted sites and substantially different compared to reference site fish. These responses were more pronounced in Chinook salmon, which is supported by the disparity in accumulated CECs. The blood chemistry results for juvenile Chinook salmon collected at effluent-impacted sites exhibited a pattern generally consistent with starvation because of similarities to observations from studies of food-deprived fish; however, this response is not consistent with physical starvation but may be contaminant induced. The altered blood chemistry parameters are useful as an early indicator of metabolic stress, even though organismal characteristics (lipid content and condition factor) were not different among sites indicating an early response. Evidence of metabolic disruption was also observed in juvenile Chinook salmon that were exposed in the laboratory to a limited mixture of CECs; however, the plasma parameters were qualitatively different possibly due to exposure route, season, or the suite of CECs. Growth was impaired in the high-dose fish during the dosing phase and the low- and medium-dose fish assayed after 2 weeks of depuration. Overall, these results are consistent with metabolic disruption for fish exposed to CECs, which may result in early mortality or an impaired ability to compete for limited resources.","

"Lower back musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are an important public health problem and the leading cause of disability worldwide, but with yet unknown prevalence among shellfish gatherers. To investigate the prevalence and work-related factors associated with lower back MSD in a population of female shellfish gatherers, an epidemiological cross-sectional study was carried out in Saubara, Bahia-Brazil, in 2013. The Brazilian version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), in addition to a questionnaire containing the physical demands adapted to the artisanal work, were applied to a random sample of 209 female shellfish gatherers. The prevalence of lower back MSD was 72.7%. Using multivariate logistic regression, the shellfish gatherers who had worked for more than 26 years in the activity showed a prevalence of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04⁻1.44) times higher compared to those unexposed. Lower back MSD was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.08⁻1.42) times higher among those more exposed to work sitting with trunk flexion. Those performed manual handling and muscle force with the arms had a prevalence ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01⁻1.39). These results show the need for greater awareness of health and social welfare factors impacting workers in small-scale fisheries and will promote the elaboration of health care policies for this occupational class.","

"An international intercomparison was organized by Working Group 7, Internal Dosimetry, of the European Radiation Dosimetry Group in collaboration with Working Group 6, Computational Dosimetry, for measurement and Monte Carlo simulation of Am in three skull phantoms. The main objectives of this combined exercise were (1) comparison of the results of counting efficiency in fixed positions over each head phantom using different germanium detector systems, (2) calculation of the activity of Am in the skulls, (3) comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with measurements (spectrum and counting efficiency), and (4) comparison of phantom performance. This initiative collected knowledge on equipment, detector arrangements, calibration procedures, and phantoms used around the world for in vivo monitoring of Am in exposed persons, as well as on the Monte Carlo skills and tools of participants. Three skull phantoms (BfS, USTUR, and CSR phantoms) were transported from Europe (10 laboratories) to North America (United States and Canada). The BfS skull was fabricated with real human bone artificially labeled with Am. The USTUR skull phantom was made from the US Transuranium and Uranium Registries whole-body donor (case 0102) who was contaminated due to an occupational intake of Am; one-half of the skull corresponds to real contaminated bone, the other half is real human bone from a noncontaminated person. Finally, the CSR phantom was fabricated as a simple hemisphere of equivalent bone and tissue material. The three phantoms differ in weight, size, and shape, which made them suitable for an efficiency study. Based on their own skull calibration, the participants calculated the activity in the three European Radiation Dosimetry Group head phantoms. The Monte Carlo intercomparison was organized in parallel with the measurement exercise using the voxel representations of the three physical phantoms; there were 16 participants. Three tasks were identified with increasing difficulty: (1) Monte Carlo simulation of the simple CSR hemisphere and the Helmholz Zentrum München high-purity germanium detector for calculating the counting efficiency for the 59.54 keV photons of Am, in established measurement geometry; (2) Monte Carlo simulation of particular measurement geometries using the BfS and USTUR voxel phantoms and the Helmholz Zentrum München high-purity germanium detector detector; and (3) application of Monte Carlo methodology to calculate the calibration factor of each participant for the detector system and counting geometry (single or multidetector arrangement) to be used for monitoring a person in each in vivo facility, using complex skull phantoms. The results of both exercises resulted in the conclusion that none of the three available head phantoms is appropriate as a reference phantom for the calibration of germanium detection systems for measuring Am in exposed adult persons. The main reasons for this are: (1) lack of homogeneous activity distribution in the bone material, or (2) inadequate shape/size for simulating an adult skull. Good agreement was found between Monte Carlo results and measurements, which supports Monte Carlo calibration of body counters as an alternative method when appropriate physical phantoms are not available and the detector and source are well known.",,Measurements and Monte Carlo Simulations of 241Am Activities in Three Skull Phantoms: EURADOS-USTUR Collaboration,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022011/
"In Germany, approximately 2 to 3 million employees work in outdoor professions. They are exceptionally exposed to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation for a large part of their daily working time. Cumulative UV exposure is associated with a significantly increased risk of skin cancer for outdoor workers from various occupational groups (e. g. landscape and horticulture, agriculture and forestry, fisheries and seafaring, construction and trade, as well as sports teachers, lifeguards and mountain guides). Since 1 January 2015, squamous cell carcinoma and multiple actinic keratosis due to natural UV radiation can be recognised as occupational disease No. 5103 by the German statutory social accident insurance. Reducing cumulative UV exposure is the main prevention aspect of this type of skin damage. Therefore, technical, organisational and personal UV protection measures should be implemented in the professional and private environment. Moreover, they have to be regularly used in an appropriate way. In addition to guideline-oriented therapy, training and counselling of patients with already existing actinic skin damage or a recognised occupational disease No. 5103 is therefore of particular importance. The focus should be on improving the individual UV protection behaviour. This article gives an overview of current recommendations for UV protection in the professional environment. It outlines possible solutions for patient counselling in terms of UV protection in everyday practice.","

      Estuarine pollution imposes rapid, increasing and lasting environmental modifications. In the present review, especial attention is given to estuaries in South America (SA), where legislation, policies and actions to guarantee environmental quality remain ineffective. There, the majority of estuaries face uncontrolled occupation of its margins by urban and industrial centres, agriculture and aquaculture expansion, water extraction and flow control. The lack of basic sanitation and poor environmental management (including territories within Marine Protected Areas) often lead to hydrological alterations, high nutrient loads, and the presence and dynamics of pollutants (nutrient loads, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and plastic debris) along the entire estuarine ecocline. Organic enrichment has increased dissolved oxygen consumption, with wide spatio-temporal variability along latitudes and estuarine gradients. The toxicity, biogeochemistry and availability of metals and POPs depend on the annual fluctuations of salinity, water renewal, dissolved oxygen levels, suspended particulate loads, sediment mobility, grain size and composition at the sink. Plastic debris from land sources are widespread in estuaries, where they continue to fragment into microplastics. River basins are the main contributors of plastics to estuaries, whose transportation and accumulation are subjected to interannual water flow variations. Although some systems seems to be in a better condition in relation to others around the world (e.g. Goiana and Negro estuaries), many others are among the most modified worldwide (e.g. Guanabara Bay and Estero Salado System). We propose that, estuarine conservation plans should consider year-round fluctuations of the ecocline and the resulting cycles of retention and flush of environmental signals and their influence on trophic webs over the whole extent of estuarine gradients.

"High-risk contaminants, OCPs and PCBs, were investigated in marine fish from the Adriatic Sea, from which retail fish in Croatia is commonly sourced. The pollutant levels in sardine, horse and chub mackerel, anchovy and round sardinella were analysed based on a two-year sampling and the joint use of generally accepted statistics and advanced clustering methods - self-organizing maps (SOM) and decision tree analysis (DT). Both the SOM and DT suggested fish mass and length rather than fat along with α-HCH, p,p'-DDT, PCB-74 and PCB-189 to cause variable pollutant uptake among species. Main distinctions of sardines occur in coastal and off coast regions rather than in a particular fishing zone and they are associated with both fish characteristics, levels of γ-HCH and PCBs: -60, -105, -150, -170, and -189.

      Folliculitis is a common skin disease, usually benign, which causes inflammation and eventual infections of hair follicles. They may have an infectious etiology, mainly due to the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus; it also occurs due to localized irritation, such as in areas of skin friction and for long periods of immersion in water, as in athletes and workers who are continuously exposed to the aquatic environment. Herein, we report on two fishermen, from fluvial and maritime environments, who presented with chronic aseptic folliculitis associated with daily immersion of their lower extremities while exercising the profession and that regressed when there was a decrease in their contact with water.

"Physiological responses to ocean acidification are thought to be related to energetic trade-offs. Although a number of studies have proposed that negative responses to low pH could be minimized in situations where food resources are more readily available, evidence for such effects on individuals remain mixed, and the consequences of such effects at the community level remain untested. We explored the potential for food availability and diet quality to modify the effects of acidification on developing marine fouling communities in field-deployed mesocosms by supplementing natural food supply with one of two species of phytoplankton, differing in concentration of fatty acids. After 12 weeks, no species demonstrated the interactive effects generally predicted in the literature, where a positive overall effect of diet mitigated the negative overall effects of acidification. Rather, for some species, additional food supply appeared to bring out or exacerbate the negative effects of low pH. Community richness and structure were only altered by acidification, while space occupation and evenness reflected patterns of the most dominant species. Importantly, we find that acidification stress can increase the relative abundance of invasive species, even under resource conditions that otherwise prevented invasive species establishment. Overall, the proposed hypothesis regarding the ability for food addition to mitigate the negative effects of acidification is thus far not widely supported at species or community levels. It is clear that acidification is a strong driving force in these communities but understanding underlying energetic and competitive context is essential to developing mechanistic predictions for climate change responses.","

Using the spinal region as a moderator, we observed that vehicle ride exposure significantly increased fatigue at the lumbar musculature (P = .02; natural log response ratio = -0.27, 95% confidence interval = -0.50, -0.04) but not at the cervical or thoracic region.

"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses with an enzootic transmission cycle like Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are a major public health concern. The circulation of JEV in Southeast Asia is well-documented, and the important role of pigs as amplification hosts for the virus is long known. The influence of other domestic animals especially poultry that lives in high abundance and close proximity to humans is not intensively analyzed. Another understudied field in Asia is the presence of the closely related WNV. Such analyses are difficult to perform due to the intense antigenic cross-reactivity between these viruses and the lack of suitable standardized serological assays. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of JEV and WNV flaviviruses in domestic birds, detailed in chickens and ducks, in three different Cambodian provinces. We determined the flavivirus seroprevalence using an hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA). Additionally, we investigated in positive samples the presence of JEV and WNV neutralizing antibodies (nAb) using foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT). We found 29% (180/620) of the investigated birds positive for flavivirus antibodies with an age-depended increase of the seroprevalence (OR = 1.04) and a higher prevalence in ducks compared to chicken (OR = 3.01). Within the flavivirus-positive birds, we found 43% (28/65) with nAb against JEV. We also observed the expected cross-reactivity between JEV and WNV, by identifying 18.5% double-positive birds that had higher titers of nAb than single-positive birds. Additionally, seven domestic birds (10.7%) showed only nAb against WNV and no nAb against JEV. Our study provides evidence for an intense JEV circulation in domestic birds in Cambodia, and the first serological evidence for WNV presence in Southeast Asia since decades. These findings mark the need for a re-definition of areas at risk for JEV and WNV transmission, and the need for further and intensified surveillance of mosquito-transmitted diseases in domestic animals.","

"To tackle the ever-present global concern regarding human exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) via food products, this study strived to indicate associations between organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in lake-fish tissue depending on the species and sampling season. Apart from the monitoring initiatives recommended in the Global Monitoring Plan for POPs, the study discussed 7 OCPs and 18 PCB congeners determined in three Cyprinidae species (rudd, carp, and Prussian carp) from Vransko Lake (Croatia), which are widely domesticated and reared as food fish across Europe and Asia. We exploit advanced classification algorithms, the Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) and Decision Trees (DT), to search for POP patterns typical for the investigated species. As indicated by SOM, some of the dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs (PCB-28, PCB-74, PCB-52, PCB-101, PCB-105, PCB-114, PCB-118, PCB-156 and PCB-157), α-HCH and β-HCH caused dissimilarities among fish species, but regardless of their weight and length. To support these suggestions, DT analysis sequenced the fish species and seasons based on the concentration of heavier congeners. The presented assumptions indicated that the supplemental application of SOM and DT offers advantageous features over the usually rough interpretation of POPs pattern and over the single use of the methods.","

"This study explored the intersection of masculinity and HIV care engagement among fishermen and other male fisherfolk on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Wakiso District, Uganda. We conducted 30 in-depth interviews with men on ART recruited from HIV treatment sites and used a thematic analysis approach. Since HIV diagnosis and ART initiation, men had adopted masculine identities more conducive to HIV care engagement. The masculine roles of worker and provider, husband and sexual partner and the appearance of physical strength were compromised by HIV, but restored by ART's positive effects on health. Peers also emerged as facilitators to HIV care, with men supporting each other to seek testing and treatment. However, structural and occupational barriers to HIV care associated with the masculine role of worker remained a barrier to care engagement. Findings suggest that emphasising the benefits of ART in bolstering men's ability to fulfil the roles important to them may improve the effectiveness of HIV testing and treatment messaging for men. Differentiated care models that address structural-level barriers to care, and community-level gender-transformative programming to help fishermen engage in HIV care, may be beneficial.","

"Commercial fishing continues to have one of the highest rates of occupational fatalities compared with other work sectors in the United States. Attitudes/beliefs among Vietnamese shrimp fishermen of the Gulf of Mexico may influence behaviors that are risk factors for fatal and nonfatal injuries. The study employs a community trial with quasi-experimental pretest/posttest intervention design. An advisory group made up of key stakeholders including representatives from the US Coast Guard was assembled. A survey was designed using the Theory of Planned Behavior as the theoretical framework. Three community groups at port sites along the Texas/Louisiana Gulf Coasts were identified. Focus groups were convened at each site to select priority areas for risk intervention using training and awareness measures. Initial and follow-up surveys were administered pre-/post-interventions for each of the three community groups (2008, n = 217 completed surveys; 2012, n = 206 completed surveys). The follow-up survey was condensed and ""intent to act"" questions were added for the priority concerns identified (noise-induced hearing loss, machinery/winches, and fatigue). Statistically significant changes (P ranging from .000 to .042) were observed in selective attitude/belief responses for hearing/noise and fatigue. Intent to action or to adopt the intervention was high among all three groups of shrimp fishermen (hearing conservation, 82.4%; machinery/winch safety, 94.6%; fatigue awareness, 95.3%). Simple, yet culturally appropriate training and awareness measures in the form of visual and written safety messages favorably influence attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intent related to priority risk factors identified by Vietnamese commercial shrimp fishermen along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts.","

"Food production is a major driver of global environmental change and the overshoot of planetary sustainability boundaries. Greater affluence in developing nations and human population growth are also increasing demand for all foods, and for animal proteins in particular. Consequently, a growing body of literature calls for the sustainable intensification of food production, broadly defined as ""producing more using less"". Most assessments of the potential for sustainable intensification rely on only one or two indicators, meaning that ecological trade-offs among impact categories that occur as production intensifies may remain unaccounted for. The present study addresses this limitation using life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify six local and global environmental consequences of intensifying aquaculture production in Bangladesh. Production data are from a unique survey of 2,678 farms, and results show multidirectional associations between the intensification of aquaculture production and its environmental impacts. Intensification (measured in material and economic output per unit primary area farmed) is positively correlated with acidification, eutrophication, and ecotoxicological impacts in aquatic ecosystems; negatively correlated with freshwater consumption; and indifferent with regard to global warming and land occupation. As production intensifies, the geographical locations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, acidifying emissions, freshwater consumption, and land occupation shift from the immediate vicinity of the farm to more geographically dispersed telecoupled locations across the globe. Simple changes in fish farming technology and management practices that could help make the global transition to more intensive forms of aquaculture be more sustainable are identified.","

"Marine macroalgae are considered as promising sustainable alternatives to conventional terrestrial animal feed resources. The advantages include high growth rate, potential cultivation in saltwater, and no occupation of arable land. Macroalgae are broadly classified as brown (Phaeophyta), red (Rhodophyta) and green (Chlorophyta) algae, and are a diverse group of marine organisms. The nutritional value of macroalgae is highly variable. The protein and essential amino acid content can be low, especially in brown species, and indigestible polysaccharides adversely affect the energy value. Optimal use of macroalgae in feeds requires suitable processing, and biorefinery approaches may increase protein content and improve nutrient availability. Macroalgae are rich in unique bioactive components and there is a growing interest in the potentially beneficial health effects of compounds such as laminarin and fucoidan in different macroalgal and macroalgal products. This review summarizes current literature on different aspects of the use of macroalgae as sources of protein and health-promoting bioactive compounds in feed for monogastric animal species. © 2018 The Authors.

"Victoria Pure Blue BO is a dye that bears some therapeutic activity and that can be retrieved in effluent or may be used in aquaculture as a prohibited drug. In this study, the metabolism and tissue distribution during uptake and depuration of VPBO were investigated in order to propose a residue marker of illegal treatment in fish. The dye was administered to rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) for one day by water bath at a dose of 0.1 mg.L-1. The concentrations of VPBO in all tissues increased rapidly during the treatment period, reaching a Cmax of 567 ± 301 μg.L-1 in plasma and 1846 μg kg-1 ±517 for liver after 2 h. After placing the rainbow trout in a clean water bath for a 64 day-period of depuration, the concentrations in the tissues and plasma decreased to reach comparable levels for muscle and for skin after 33 days. The concentrations measured were still above the LOQ at 2.26 ± 0.48 μg kg-1 for muscle and 2.85 ± 1.99 μg kg-1 for skin at the end of the depuration period. The results indicated the existence of 14 phase I metabolites and one glucuronide conjugated metabolite. Non-compartmental analysis was applied to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters. The half-life in edible muscle of the main metabolite detected, deethyl-leuco-VPBO, was found to be 22.5 days compared to a half-life of 19.7 days for the parent VPBO. This study provides new information to predict a VPBO drug treatment of aquacultured species via a proposed new residue marker.","

"Muscle, liver and kidney of 21 Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) from Mosor Mountain, Croatia, were sampled to quantify the activity of caesium and potassium radionuclides and five toxic and ten essential stabile elements in order to establish reference values for this species and to evaluate the potential of Barbary sheep tissues to reflect environmental pollution. We also assessed seasonal diet (botanical composition and dry matter content) of Barbary sheep based on analyses of a rumen content of culled animals. None of the 19 plant species (mostly grasses) identified as part of the Barbary sheep diet is known as a stabile element or radionuclide hyperaccumulator. Measured levels reflected low environmental pollution with arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead, with levels generally less than those reported for wild herbivorous ungulates. Methodological differences (detection limit of elements in muscle) were shown to hamper interpretation and comparison of the Toxic Contamination Index (TCI) values with those published for other species. There was no homeostasis disturbance of trace elements in Barbary sheep, either due to inadequate intake via food or as an adverse effect due to a high toxic metal(loid) burden. Consumption of the muscle and liver of wild Barbary sheep can be considered safe for the health of adult consumers regarding toxic metal(loid)s and radioactive caesium, though the liver should be avoided as a food item in vulnerable population groups due to the possible adverse effects of cadmium and lead. Otherwise, muscle and liver are a rich source of copper, iron, selenium and zinc for consumers and, as such, can benefit the overall dietary intake of essential elements.","

The sample preparation was started by acid-treatment with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (NBA) to liberate matrix-bound residues of nitrofurans. A modified QuEChERS method was optimized for the extraction and clean-up of the target analytes. The metabolites of the four conventional nitrofurans (nitrofurantoin, furazolidone, nitrofurazone and furaltadone) and of three other nitrofurans (nifursol, nifuroxazide, and nitrovin), and an underivatizable nitrofuran (nifurpirinol) were simultaneously detected. Furthermore, 21 banned substances were quantified by LC-MS/MS with ESI using one single injection. To evaluate and validate the performance of the method, the criteria of the Decision (EC) no 2002/657 were applied. Decision limit (CCα) of target analytes ranged 0.067-1.655 μg/kg in aquaculture products.

"Formalin, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde and methanol, is widely used in aquaculture facilities to treat water molds during egg incubation. Given the carcinogenic properties of formaldehyde, an understanding of the occupational exposure of aquaculture workers is essential. This study evaluated formaldehyde levels in a production fish hatchery incubation room under six different formalin treatment scenarios: one, three, or five vertical flow incubation stacks received 1,667 mg L-1 formalin treatments for 15 min with the incubation room door either open or closed. The results indicate that the level of formaldehyde being aerosolized increased as the number of stacks treated increased, with maximum levels ranging from approximately 0.5 ppm when only one stack was treated to over 2.0 ppm when five stacks were treated and the door was closed. Having the door open during formalin treatment resulted in significantly lower aerosolized formalin levels when three or five stacks were treated and a reduction in the time required for a return to basal levels when five stacks were treated. Based on these results, it is imperative that hatchery workers are able to leave confined incubation locations or use appropriate safety equipment during formalin treatments.","

As a result, interventions aimed at increasing and measuring the use of personal flotation devices (PFDs) are a high priority. The focus of this study was to explore the use of accelerometers as a means for objectively measuring PFD use on lobster fishing vessels.

      For participating vessels, researchers attached an accelerometer to a PFD worn by a crewmember and another to the vessel's wheelhouse. GoPro videos were also employed to record crewmember activities so these could be synchronized with accelerometer outputs. Accelerometer outputs included two distinct measures, the proportional integration mode (PIM) and zero crossing mode (ZCM). Data were fitted to various equations to identify the best method for predicting PFD use.

In particular, a logistic equation incorporating PIM values from the PFD and the absolute value of the difference between the PFD PIM readings and the PIM readings from the stationary accelerometer demonstrated the highest degree of accuracy, with correct classifications for 73.3% to 77.6% of the 10-second data intervals. Accuracy was highest when crew members were moving versus stationary. The predictive value of ZCM was comparatively limited.

"The number of dairy cows milked in automatic milking systems (AMS) is steadily increasing in Norway. Capacity and efficiency of AMS are highly dependent on the individual cow's milking efficiency, such as milking speed and occupation time in the milking robot. Cows meet new challenges in herds utilizing AMS. Consequently, new or revised traits may be needed for genetic evaluation of dairy cattle. The AMS records relevant information on an individual cow basis. The aims of this study were to estimate genetic parameters of new automatically recorded milkability and temperament traits. Data from 77 commercial herds with Norwegian Red dairy cattle were analyzed by mixed linear animal models. The final data set contained 1,012,912 daily records from 4,883 cows in first to ninth lactation. For variance component estimation, univariate and bivariate models were used. Daily records of box time (BT), average flow rate (FR), kilograms of milk per minute of box time (MEF), handling time (HT), log-transformed HT, milking frequency, and milking interval were analyzed with repeatability models. Among these traits, FR, BT, and MEF showed the highest heritabilities of 0.48, 0.27, and 0.22, respectively, whereas heritability of log-transformed HT, HT, milking frequency, and milking interval was low (0.02-0.07). Unsuccessful milkings expressed as rejected milkings, incomplete milkings (IM), milkings with kick-offs (KO), and teat not found also showed low heritabilities (0.002-0.06). Due to low frequency, KO, rejected milkings, IM, and teat not found were also analyzed as proportions per lactation, which resulted in slightly higher heritability estimates. Genetic correlations were favorable and intermediate to strong between BT, HT, MEF, and FR with absolute values above 0.50. Intermediate and favorable correlations were found for IM and KO with BT, HT, MEF, and FR. Cow milkability in AMS can be improved by selection for reduced number of unsuccessful milkings, faster FR, increased MEF, and shorter BT and HT. Our results confirm that automatically recorded data on milkability and temperament can be valuable sources of information for routine genetic evaluations and that milking efficiency in AMS can be genetically improved.","

"Background:
        
      
      Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis of public health importance transmitted through contact with contaminated soil, water or urine of infected animals. In pigs the disease is characterized by abortion, still births and weak piglets. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May to July 2018 to estimate the sero-prevalence of leptospirosis and factors associated with seropositivity in slaughter pigs. A questionnaire was used to collect information on animal demographics. Serum was tested for anti-leptospiral antibodies using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with a panel of 8 serovars. Sera were considered positive for sero-reactivity at a MAT titre ≥1:40 against at least one serovar. Chi-square tests were used to measure the strength of association between the MAT test result and exploratory variables.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      A total of 252 pig serum samples from seven slaughterhouses were tested for Leptospira antibodies by MAT. Of the 252 pigs sampled, 88.8% (244/252) were indigenous breeds; 55.6% (140/252) were female and 88.7% (220/252) were reared in extensive production systems. Eighty-three (32.9%; 83/252) sera samples tested positive on MAT against at least one serovar. Of the 8 serovars, the highest prevalence was recorded for serovar Lora 21.4% followed by Kenya 5.2%, Sokoine 3.6% and Grippotyphosa at 3.2%. Risk factors for leptospirosis seropositivity in pigs were: originating from farms with other types of livestock (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.0-4.5) and mature pigs (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.3).

      This study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of leptospirosis positive pigs at slaughter in a small-holder livestock keeping region of the Lake Victoria basin. The potential for cross species transmission of pathogenic serovars is highlighted as well as the potential for occupational exposure to slaughterhouse personnel. Improvements in husbandry practices (confinement and rodent control) and public health education among slaughterhouse workers and other high-risk groups is recommended.","

      Objectives: Safety at sea is an often overlooked aspect of well-being that fisheries management actions can affect, even when management actions are not intended to affect safety. Catch shares management has been associated with longer fishing seasons and a decline in the intensity of competition among fishers. This study assesses changes in exposure of Alaska's commercial crab fisheries to relatively high-risk weather conditions after rationalization, or catch shares management, was implemented.Methods: We compare the rates of fishing in high-wind conditions in the Bristol Bay red king and the Bering Sea snow/tanner crab fisheries pre- and post-rationalization. We also compare results to a portion of the crab fishery that did not undergo the same change in management.Results: The rate of high wind fishing in the snow/tanner crab fishery fell post-rationalization, but increased in the red king crab fishery.Conclusion: When the red king and snow/tanner crab fisheries are considered together, rationalization led to longer seasons and improved flexibility to choose when to fish according to weather conditions. The snow crab fishery experienced a marked decline in higher-risk fishing after rationalization. Results are contrary to expectations for the king crab fisherybecause the flexibility in trip timing provided by the program produced a shift in their season toward winter months when average wind speeds are higher.

"This review provides focused insights into the contamination status, sources, and ecological risks associated with multiple classes of antibiotics in surface water from the East and Southeast Asia based on publications over the period 2007 to 2020. Antibiotics are ubiquitous in surface water of these countries with concentrations ranging from <1 ng/L to hundreds μg/L and median values from 10 to 100 ng/L. Wider ranges and higher maximum concentrations of certain antibiotics were found in surface water of the East Asian countries like China and South Korea than in the Southeast Asian nations. Environmental behavior and fate of antibiotics in surface water is discussed. The reviewed occurrence of antibiotics in their sources suggests that effluent from wastewater treatment plants, wastewater from aquaculture and livestock production activities, and untreated urban sewage are principal sources of antibiotics in surface water. Ecological risks associated with antibiotic residues were estimated for aquatic organisms and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were reviewed. Such findings underline the need for synergistic efforts from scientists, engineers, policy makers, government managers, entrepreneurs, and communities to manage and reduce the burden of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in water bodies of East and Southeast Asian countries.","

In the present investigation, we selected an extremely complex and unique environment supporting unexplored endophytes, 'Macroalgae of Kerala coast, India'. Unlike terrestrial flora and mangroves, reports displaying endophytic assemblages of marine flora remain limited, especially from India. The main goal of this study was to expose hidden endophytic fungi from macroalgae and examination of their bioactive potential. An ecological investigation of four red, four green and three brown algae resulted in 133 fungal taxa with 29 distinct morphospecies. Aspergillus and Penicillium were found to be the dominant genera. Penicillium chrysogenum was the sole fungi that contributed 11% of the entire endophytic community. Antimicrobial activity against various aquaculture/human pathogens revealed that around 59% of endophytes inhibited at least one of the pathogens screened. The maximum number of isolates (37%) inhibited Escherichia coli tailed by Aspergillus fumigatus (27%). Antimicrobial profile of fungal endophytes endorses them as a potential source of bioactive molecules that can be explored to find a solution for drug resistance in microbial pathogens.","

"Understanding feedbacks between human and environmental health is critical for the millions who cope with recurrent illness and rely directly on natural resources for sustenance. Although studies have examined how environmental degradation exacerbates infectious disease, the effects of human health on our use of the environment remains unexplored. Human illness is often tacitly assumed to reduce human impacts on the environment. By this logic, ill people reduce the time and effort that they put into extractive livelihoods and, thereby, their impact on natural resources. We followed 303 households living on Lake Victoria, Kenya over four time points to examine how illness influenced fishing. Using fixed effect conditional logit models to control for individual-level and time-invariant factors, we analyzed the effect of illness on fishing effort and methods. Illness among individuals who listed fishing as their primary occupation affected their participation in fishing. However, among active fishers, we found limited evidence that illness reduced fishing effort. Instead, ill fishers shifted their fishing methods. When ill, fishers were more likely to use methods that were illegal, destructive, and concentrated in inshore areas but required less travel and energy. Ill fishers were also less likely to fish using legal methods that are physically demanding, require travel to deep waters, and are considered more sustainable. By altering the physical capacity and outlook of fishers, human illness shifted their effort, their engagement with natural resources, and the sustainability of their actions. These findings show a previously unexplored pathway through which poor human health may negatively impact the environment.","

"This study was designed to assess the occurrence and concentrations of a broad range of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from three local estuaries within a large estuarine ecosystem. In addition to effluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), we sampled water and whole-body juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) in estuaries receiving effluent. We analyzed these matrices for 150 compounds, which included pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), and several industrial compounds. Collectively, we detected 81 analytes in effluent, 25 analytes in estuary water, and 42 analytes in fish tissue. A number of compounds, including sertraline, triclosan, estrone, fluoxetine, metformin, and nonylphenol were detected in water and tissue at concentrations that may cause adverse effects in fish. Interestingly, 29 CEC analytes were detected in effluent and fish tissue, but not in estuarine waters, indicating a high potential for bioaccumulation for these compounds. Although concentrations of most detected analytes were present at relatively low concentrations, our analysis revealed that overall CEC inputs to each estuary amount to several kilograms of these compounds per day. This study is unique because we report on CEC concentrations in estuarine waters and whole-body fish, which are both uncommon in the literature. A noteworthy finding was the preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in free-ranging juvenile Chinook salmon relative to staghorn sculpin, a benthic species with relatively high site fidelity.","

      Exposure to mercury is a silent threat to the environment and human life. It has the potential to harm almost every organ and body system. Mercury compounds are classified in different chemical types such as elemental, inorganic, and organic forms. The most significant source of ingestion-related mercury exposure in humans and animals is the consumption of fish. Long-term exposure to mercury compounds from different sources (e.g., water, food, soil, and air) can lead to toxic effects on skin, cardiovascular, pulmonary, urinary, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Mercury toxicity is found to pose more significant health hazards to certain occupational groups (e.g., goldminers and dental personnel). Because continuous exposure to mercury can be dangerous, it is desirable to re-evaluate the current reference (risk-free) values. This paper reviews the route of Hg exposure to humans, its human health impacts, the associated risk assessment, and treatment based on the recent findings from various studies.

"Body size is frequently claimed to be a major determinant of animal trophic interactions, yet few studies have explored relationships between body size and trophic interactions in rivers, especially within the tropics. We examined relationships between body size and trophic position (TP) within fish assemblages in four lowland rivers of the Lower Mekong Basin in Cambodia. Stable isotope analysis (based on δ15N) was used to estimate TP of common fish species in each river, and species were classified according to occupation of benthic versus pelagic habitats and major feeding guilds. Regression analysis yielded strong correlations between body size and TP among fishes from the Sesan and Sreprok rivers, but not those from the Mekong and Sekong rivers. The Mekong fish assemblage had higher average TP compared with those of other rivers. The relationship between body size and TP was positive and significantly correlated for piscivores and omnivores, but not for detritivores and insectivores. The body size-TP relationship did not differ between pelagic and benthic fishes. Body size significantly predicted TP within the orders Siluriformes and Perciformes, but not for Cypriniformes, the most species-rich and ecologically diverse order in the Lower Mekong River. We conclude that for species-rich, tropical fish assemblages with many detritivores and invertivores, body size would not be an appropriate surrogate for TP in food web models and other ecological applications.","

      Although some important features of genetically modified (GM) crops such as insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, and drought tolerance might seem to be beneficial for small-scale farmers, the adoption of GM technology by smallholders is still slight. Identifying pros and cons of using this technology is important to understand the impacts of GM crops on these farmers. This article reviews the main opportunities and challenges of GM crops for small-scale farmers in developing countries. The most significant advantages of GM crops include being independent to farm size, environment protection, improvement of occupational health issues, and the potential of bio-fortified crops to reduce malnutrition. Challenges faced by small-scale farmers for adoption of GM crops comprise availability and accessibility of GM crop seeds, seed dissemination and price, and the lack of adequate information. In addition, R&D and production costs in using GM crops make it difficult for these farmers to adopt the use of these crops. Moreover, intellectual property right regulations may deprive resource poor farmers from the advantages of GM technology. Finally, concerns on socio-economic and environment safety issues are also addressed in this paper.

"So far, several classes of digesting solutions have been employed to extract microplastics (MPs) from biological matrices. However, the performance of digesting solutions across different temperatures has never been systematically investigated. In the first phase of the present study, we measured the efficiency of different oxidative agents (NaClO or H2O2), bases (NaOH or KOH), and acids [HCl or HNO3; concentrated and diluted (5%)] in digesting fish tissues at room temperature (RT, 25°C), 40, 50, or 60°C. In the second phase, the treatments that were efficient in digesting the biological materials (>95%) were evaluated for their compatibility with eight major plastic polymers (assessed through recovery rate, Raman spectroscopy analysis, and morphological changes). Among the tested solutions, NaClO, NaOH, and diluted acids did not result in a satisfactory digestion efficiency at any of the temperatures. The H2O2 treatment at 50°C efficiently digested the biological materials, although it decreased the recovery rate of nylon-6 (NY6) and nylon-66 (NY66) and altered the colour of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fragments. Similarly, concentrated HCl and HNO3 treatments at RT fully digested the fish tissues, but also fully dissolved NY6 and NY66, and reduced the recovery rate of most or all of the polymers, respectively. Potassium hydroxide solution fully eliminated the biological matrices at all temperatures. However, at 50 and 60°C, it degraded PET, reduced the recovery rate of PET and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and changed the colour of NY66. According to our results, treating biological materials with a 10% KOH solution and incubating at 40°C was both time and cost-effective, efficient in digesting biological materials, and had no impact on the integrity of the plastic polymers. Furthermore, coupling this treatment with NaI extraction created a promising protocol to isolate MPs from whole fish samples.","

Using a 2015 national dataset, we estimated the mortality rates due to gastric cancer in Japanese male and female workers aged 25-64 yr. Regression models were used to estimate the mortality rate ratios separately for men and women with adjustment for age. The occupation with the highest risk ratio was ""Service"" in men (2.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.63-2.61) and ""Construction and Mining"" in women compared with ""Sales"". For industries, workers in ""Mining"", ""Electricity, Gas, Heat supply and Water"", ""Fisheries"", ""Agriculture and Forestry"", and ""Construction"" had a higher mortality risk. Our results showed that occupations and industries with higher mortality rates in men had the same trend as the results from 2010, and occupations and industries with higher mortality rates in women were almost the same as those in men. The analyses also indicated that managerial and professional workers in Japan had higher mortality as opposed to developed Western countries.

      This descriptive epidemiologic study aimed to explore the application and modification of the WPCS in multiple Alaskan fleets, characterize non-fatal occupational injuries in these fleets, and identify work processes that could be targeted for further investigation and future injury prevention efforts.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Design:
        
      
      Traumatic, non-fatal injuries on-board Alaskan commercial fishing vessels were identified through United States Coast Guard investigative reports. Characteristics of injuries, as well as worker characteristics, were analysed. Injuries were coded using the WPCS.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      We successfully utilized the WPCS to code non-fatal injury cases (n = 136). The most frequent main work processes associated with non-fatal injuries included: on-board trawlers, handling frozen fish and processing the catch; on-board vessels using pot/trap gear, handling the gear and shooting/setting the gear; on-board longliners, traffic on board and hauling the gear; and on-board processor vessels, processing the catch, other work with the catch, and handling frozen fish.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study confirmed that a WPCS can be applied to multiple Alaskan fleets to identify hazardous tasks. Hazards were unique for each vessel gear type. Future injury prevention efforts should target work processes associated with the most frequent and most severe injuries. Future studies should establish time estimates for work processes in order to determine risk estimates. Efforts to improve non-fatal injury reporting, especially on smaller commercial fishing vessels, should be undertaken.","

"The Fish Plasma Model (FPM) was applied to water exposure and tissue concentrations in fish collected from two wastewater treatment plant impacted estuarine sites. In this study we compared predicted fish plasma concentrations to Cmax values for humans, which represents the maximum plasma concentration for the minimum therapeutic dose. The results of this study show that predictions of plasma concentrations for a variety of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from effluent concentrations resulted in 37 compounds (54%) exceeding the response ratio (RR = Fish [Plasma]/1%Cmaxtotal) of 1 compared to 3 compounds (14%) detected with values generated with estuarine receiving water concentrations. When plasma concentrations were modeled from observed whole-body tissue residues, 16 compounds out of 24 detected for Chinook (67%) and 7 of 14 (50%) for sculpin resulted in an RRtissue value greater than 1, which highlights the importance of this dose metric over that using estuarine water. Because the tissue residue approach resulted in a high percentage of compounds with calculated response ratios exceeding a value of unity, we believe this is a more accurate representation for exposure in the field. Predicting plasma concentrations from tissue residues improves our ability to assess the potential for adverse effects in fish because exposure from all sources is captured. Tissue residues are also more likely to represent steady-state conditions compared to those from water exposure because of the inherent reduction in variability usually observed for field data and the time course for bioaccumulation. We also examined the RR in a toxic unit approach to highlight the importance of considering multiple compounds exhibiting a similar mechanism of action.","

"The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is one of the most crude oil impacted deltas globally. The region has experienced over five decades of oil related contamination of the total environment (air, soil, water and biota). In 2011, UNEP released a seminal report on oil impact on Ogoniland environments, which up scaled demands for urgent clean up and restoration of degraded bio-resource rich environments of the Niger Delta, starting from Ogoniland. The Nigerian Government demonstrated renewed political will to remediate contaminated sites in Ogoniland with a launch of the clean-up exercise in June 2016. Stakeholders' expectations from the clean-up include not only environmental remediation but also restoration and creation of sustainable livelihood opportunities to reduce poverty in the region. Most studies have focused on the environmental restoration aspect and identified bioremediation as the likely appropriate remediation approach for Ogoniland, given its low environmental footprints, and low-cost burden on the weak and overstretched economy of Nigeria. This study mapped opportunities for sustainable livelihood creation during the Ogoniland remediation and restoration exercise. Given the value chain of bioremediation and its ancillary activities, the study analysed opportunities and mechanisms for skilled and unskilled job creation and prospects for sustainable livelihoods and knock-on effects. It is anticipated that the clean-up process would lead to economic prosperity and mitigate resource-driven conflicts in the Niger Delta. The study provides an exemplar for waste-to-wealth transformation in regions where natural resource mining has impacted communities, and has dislocated local economies and age-old livelihood structures.","

"Contamination of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in tap water is an emerging global issue, and there are abundant influencing factors that have an ambivalent eﬀect on their transportation and fate. Different housing types vary in terms of water distribution system operation and design, water consumption choices, and other hydraulic factors, which potentially affect the dynamics, loadings, and partitioning of pollutants in tap water. Thus, this study analyzed 18 multiclass EDCs in tap water from different housing types (i.e., landed and high-rise) and the associated health risks. Sample analyses revealed the presence of 16 EDCs, namely hormones (5), pharmaceuticals (8), a pesticide (1), and plasticizers (2) in tap water, with the prevalent occurrence of bisphenol A up to 66.40 ng/L in high-rise housing. The presence of caffeine and sulfamethoxazole distribution in tap water was significantly different between landed and high-rise housings (t(152) = -2.298, p = 0.023 and t(109) = 2.135, p = 0.035). Moreover, the salinity and conductivity of tap water in high-rise housings were significantly higher compared to those in landed housings (t(122) = 2.411, p = 0.017 and t(94) = 2.997, p = 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, there were no potential health risks of EDCs (risk quotient < 1) estimated in different age groups via drinking water intake. However, EDC variation in different housing types requires simulation of the occurrence, transport, and fate of EDCs in the distribution system and investigation of the underlying factors for effective mitigation, prevention, and intervention.","

      Little is known about the types of intestinal parasites that infected people living in prehistoric Britain. The Late Bronze Age archaeological site of Must Farm was a pile-dwelling settlement located in a wetland, consisting of stilted timber structures constructed over a slow-moving freshwater channel. At excavation, sediment samples were collected from occupation deposits around the timber structures. Fifteen coprolites were also hand-recovered from the occupation deposits; four were identified as human and seven as canine, using fecal lipid biomarkers. Digital light microscopy was used to identify preserved helminth eggs in the sediment and coprolites. Eggs of fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum and Diphyllobothrium dendriticum), Echinostoma sp., giant kidney worm (Dioctophyma renale), probable pig whipworm (Trichuris suis) and Capillaria sp. were found. This is the earliest evidence for fish tapeworm, Echinostoma worm, Capillaria worm and the giant kidney worm so far identified in Britain. It appears that the wetland environment of the settlement contributed to establishing parasite diversity and put the inhabitants at risk of infection by helminth species spread by eating raw fish, frogs or molluscs that flourish in freshwater aquatic environments, conversely the wetland may also have protected them from infection by certain geohelminths.

Both groups were male, comparable for age and educational level. The survey support was an individual questionnaire covering socio-demographic characteristics, toxic habits and ordalique functioning questionnaire (le questionnaire de fonctionnement ordalique, QFO).

The search yielded only 4 studies, described in 5 articles. Three studies (one each in Turkey, Egypt and Spain) provided data on self-reported eye problems in fishermen or fishery workers, with prevalence ranging from 38% to 81%. There was only one study in the literature that objectively assessed the burden and causes of vision impairment and blindness in fishing communities. None of the studies examined availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of eye care services. We conclude that marginalized fishing communities are almost non-existent in eye health literature.

There was a moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.5025) of Brucella IgG concentrations (> 200 U/ml) and clinical data for Brucella IgG ELISA seropositive humans. Several potential factors were associated (P > 0.05) with increased risk of human brucellosis seroprevalence among the abattoir personnel. The abattoir personnel were essentially males; the seropositive respondents were male and did not use protective equipment at work. Handling of foetus and uterine contents (OR = 13.00, 95%CI: 1.51-111.88) was associated with increased risk of human brucellosis.

"The aim of this study was to determine the level of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and selected heavy metals among fishermen via dietary intake of fish and other seafood from the eastern coast along the Straits of Malacca. This study determined the neurobehavioural performances (based on neurobehavioural core test battery scores) of the fishermen and evaluated the correlations between scores of neurobehavioural core test battery and exposure factors. Ninety fishermen participated in the study. The total fish intakes of the fishermen were measured using a set of food frequency questionnaires. The PCBs contents in the seafood samples ranged between 0.2 and 0.6 pg/g fresh sample. The concentrations of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in the seafood samples were 1.1-5.4, 0.3-4.4, 0.6-36.1, and 0.02-0.3 μg/g fresh sample, respectively. The PCBs, Hg, As, Cd, and Pb exposures of the fishermen was estimated to be 2.8, 0.02, 4.5, 0.09, and 0.5 pg/kg body weight/day, respectively. PCB and heavy metal exposures through dietary intake of fish and seafood were within the tolerable daily limits. The results of neurobehavioural core test battery revealed that the neurobehavioural performances of the fishermen were not affected due to PCB and heavy metal intoxication. No correlations were found between the exposure and neurobehavioural performance among the fishermen. These data are useful for policy makers to assure the safety and quality of seafood in relation to sea pollution. Although the levels of exposure were low, periodic assessment of the quality of fish and fish products is required due to the polluted seawater.",,"

"The 2015 U.S. West Coast domoic acid event was caused by a massive harmful algal bloom (HAB) that consisted mostly of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis. It was unprecedented in its toxicity and geographic extent and resulted in extended and widespread closures of the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab and popular recreational razor clam fisheries. The fishery closures led to federal fisheries disaster declarations and generated an economic shock for coastal communities that depend on access to these marine resources. This study reports on the socioeconomic impacts of the 2015 HAB across 16 fishing communities on the U.S. West Coast using primary survey data. The survey instrument, deployed in the summer of 2017, collected information on sociodemographic and economic factors hypothesized to confer resilience or vulnerability to HABs, data quantifying individual impacts, and the coping and adaptive actions taken by individuals to deal with the event. The vast majority of survey participants (84%) were negatively impacted by the 2015 HAB, but individuals employed in fishing-related occupations experienced greater financial, emotional, and sociocultural impacts than those employed in other sectors. Further, those employed in fishing-related occupations were less likely to recover financial losses suffered as a result of the event. This study identifies the pathways through which HABs affect fishery-dependent and fishery-associated sectors of U.S. West Coast communities. The understanding gained can help inform efforts to prepare for future HABs, mitigate their socioeconomic impacts, and aid recovery.","

"Mobile cranes account for a considerable proportion of crane-related accidents in South Korea. The authors used descriptive and non-parametric statistics to analyse 245 fatal accidents in South Korea from 2007 to 2016. The results showed that human error and crane problems were the main cause of accidents; riggers accounted for the largest number of deaths. To reduce the number of mobile crane fatalities, the authors made recommendations in four areas: educational aspects, mobile crane aspects, technical aspects and other issues. Firstly, business owners need to establish a systematic education system suitable for workers in mobile crane operations. Secondly, efforts should be made to tighten the quality of safety inspections of cranes and supervision of workplaces. Thirdly, efforts should be made to develop more human error-free equipment. Lastly, it is necessary to develop a systematic accident reporting system containing more detailed information to allow a fuller understanding of accident causation.","

      Human hair is considered as a potential biowaste worldwide, and improper disposal of hair can create multiple environmental problems. Due to unique characteristic features, human waste hair can be efficiently utilized for versatile applications, from agricultural industries to fashion industries. There is a huge business of human hair in many multinational countries and also in some rural areas of India. The continuous demand of such keratinous waste for human need in turn is producing residual waste at an alarming rate that causes environmental degradation. Therefore, our study aims to investigate the possible impacts of waste hair reprocessing activity on environmental health in rural India, citing examples from Radhapur village. Physico-chemical parameters of pond water and soil from the dumpsite were assessed. Along with this, elemental profile of waste hair, pond water and soil was estimated. To assess the deterioration of water quality, zooplankton diversity was also measured. Water quality index showed that the studied ponds are unsuitable for drinking purpose and aquaculture. The Shannon index further indicated comparatively lower diversity of zooplankton community in the studied ponds. Due to the presence of total organic carbon and available N-P-K, the soil can sustain the growth and survival of plants; however, the risk of toxic metal accumulation may be persisted. Hence, to enhance the utilization of waste hair in a large scale, a policy framework is extremely required that will incorporate environmental and social well-being and provide necessary support towards sustainable development. Future study needs to be carried out to eliminate the toxic elements from the water and soil using some phytoremediation strategies.

"Background:
        
      
      In Southeast Asia, though fishermen are known to be a key population at high risk of HIV, little is known about their co-infection rates with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), or how illness and risk behaviors vary by occupation or type of fishermen. In Myanmar, this lack of knowledge is particularly acute, despite the fact that much of the country's border is coastline.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess clinical, demographic, and risk characteristics of HIV-infected, ≥15-year-old males under HIV care from 2004 to 2014. Subgroups of fishermen were categorized according to the location of fishing activities, boat ownership, and length of time at sea. Generalized linear models assessed odds of high risk behaviors, including MSM (men who have sex with men), transactional sex, injection drug use (IDU), and HCV co-infection among international, local subsistence, and national migrant fishermen.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Of 2798 adult males who enrolled in HIV care between 2004 and 2014, 41.9% (n = 1172) were fishermen. Among these, migrants had the highest odds of engaging in risk behaviors such as sex work (Myanmar national migrants: OR 3.26 95% CI: 2.20 to 4.83), and injecting drugs (international migrants: OR 2.93, 95% CI: 1.22 to 3.87) when compared to the general male HIV clinic population. 15.9% of all fishermen reported past or current IDU (23.0% of international migrants). 22.8% of all fishermen were also co-infected with HCV, and though predictably injectors had the highest odds (OR 20.1, 95% CI: 13.7 to 29.5), even after controlling for other risk factors, fishermen retained higher odds (OR 2.37 95% CI: 1.70 to 3.32).

"The Anthropocene has brought substantial change to ocean ecosystems, but whether this age will bring more or less marine disease is unknown. In recent years, the accelerating tempo of epizootic and zoonotic disease events has made it seem as if disease is on the rise. Is this apparent increase in disease due to increased observation and sampling effort, or to an actual rise in the abundance of parasites and pathogens? We examined the literature to track long-term change in the abundance of two parasitic nematode genera with zoonotic potential: Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. These anisakid nematodes cause the disease anisakidosis and are transmitted to humans in undercooked and raw marine seafood. A total of 123 papers published between 1967 and 2017 met our criteria for inclusion, from which we extracted 755 host-parasite-location-year combinations. Of these, 69.7% concerned Anisakis spp. and 30.3% focused on Pseudoterranova spp. Meta-regression revealed an increase in Anisakis spp. abundance (average number of worms/fish) over a 53 year period from 1962 to 2015 and no significant change in Pseudoterranova spp. abundance over a 37 year period from 1978 to 2015. Standardizing changes to the period of 1978-2015, so that results are comparable between genera, we detected a significant 283-fold increase in Anisakis spp. abundance and no change in the abundance of Pseudoterranova spp. This increase in Anisakis spp. abundance may have implications for human health, marine mammal health, and fisheries profitability.","

"LC-MS/MS method for confirmation of nitrofuran metabolites in meat and aquaculture products, including the nifursol metabolite (DNSH), was developed. The nitrofuran metabolites investigated were as follows: 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), 3-amino-5-morpholinomethyl-2-oxazolidinone (AMOZ), 1-aminohydantoine (AHD), semicarbazide (SEM) and 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid hydrazide (DNSH). The sample preparation includes a washing step, allowing to analyze only the fraction of protein-bound residues. The final optimized recovery solvent for injection was found to be a mixture of ammonium acetate 2 mM/acetonitrile (60/40 ; v/v). Matrix effects and stability in biological matrix and standard solution for DNSH have been also carried out.

"Barn climate is believed to play a major role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. However, the exact air quality parameters associated with (sub)clinical pneumonia or airway inflammation in calves are currently unknown. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess associations of air quality parameters with clinical signs, lung consolidation, pulmonary inflammation and infection in group-housed calves. In total, 60 beef and dairy farms were visited from January to April 2017 and 428 calves sampled. Measured air quality parameters included continuous 24-h measurements of ammonia concentration, relative humidity and temperature and punctual measurements of air velocity, ammonia, CO2 and bacterial air load. Calf sampling consisted of clinical examination, thoracic ultrasonography and broncho-alveolar lavage sampling for bacteriological and cytological analysis of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALf). Average air temperature was 14.2 °C (standard deviation (SD) 4.4, range 5.5-23.9) and relative humidity 68.8 % (SD 8.9, range 52.2-91.6). Average ammonia concentration was 1.7 ppm (SD 0.9, range 0-10.0). Lung consolidations of ≥1 cm, ≥3 cm and ≥6 cm in depth were present in 41.1 % (176/428), 27.1 % (116/428) and 16.1 % (69/428) of the calves, respectively. Average pen temperature was positively associated with consolidations of ≥1 cm (P = 0.005), ≥3 cm (P = 0.002) and ≥6 cm (P < 0.01). Ammonia exposure, in hours>4 ppm, was associated with lung consolidation ≥1 cm (odds ratio (OR) = 1.73; confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-3.07; P = 0.04). Ammonia concentration was positively associated with BALf epithelial cell percentage (P = 0.01). Air velocity >0.8 m/s was associated with increased odds of lung consolidation of ≥3 cm (OR = 6.8; CI = 1.2-38.5; P = 0.04) and ≥6 cm (OR = 15.9; CI = 1.2-200.0; P = 0.03). The prevalence of lung consolidations ≥1 cm was higher in the draught (81.8 %; P = 0.0092) and warm, dry and ammonia accumulation clusters (54.2 %; P = 0.02) compared to the presumably normal cluster (31.6 %). In addition, in the warm, dry and ammonia cluster the prevalence of lung consolidations ≥3 cm (38.1 %; P = 0.04) and ≥6 cm (31.4 %; P = 0.01) in depth were higher compared to the presumably normal climate cluster (18.2 % and 9.1 %, respectively). Of all frequently measured indoor air quality parameters, only average temperature, ammonia concentration and air velocity were associated with pneumonia and might therefore be preferable for cost-effective evaluation of calf barn climate.","

"The growing seal populations of the Baltic have led to more frequent interactions with coastal fisheries. The motivation for seals to interact with fishing gear is high. It provides high densities of fish. A successful means of mitigating the conflict is the pontoon trap. Seal visits here have been frequent. Seals have access to most parts of the trap system including the middle chamber, which is an overhead environment. Concerns have been raised about seals possible entanglement in this specific part of the trap. As a means of keeping seals from entering the middle chamber, two different Seal Exclusion Devices (SEDs) were tested. A diamond mesh SED and a square mesh SED, which was rotated 45°. The aim was to compare the functionality of the different SEDs with respect to seal deterrent abilities and catch composition. The hypothesis tested were (i) that seals would not be able to enter the middle chamber, (ii) that the catch would increase and (iii) that the SED would deter larger fish from swimming into the middle chamber. Catch data and underwater film were collected. Larger salmons were caught in traps equipped with SEDs. The SEDs did not affect the number of caught fish or the total catch per soak day.",,"

No case-control or cohort studies of occupational REE exposures were retrieved. Environmental exposures have been biomonitored in populations residing in REE mining areas, showing REE accumulation. The case for a iatrogenic REE exposure was raised by the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents for nuclear magnetic resonance. Animal toxicity studies have shown REE toxicity, affecting a number of endpoints in liver, lungs and blood. On the other hand, the use of REE as feed additives in livestock is referred as a safe and promising device in zootechnical activities, possibly suggesting a hormetic effect both known for REE and for other xenobiotics. Thus, investigations on long-term exposures and observations are warranted.

"Imatinib mesylate (IM) is an anticancer drug that belongs to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We report the results of the first investigation of the chronic exposure of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to IM. The exposure to IM (0.01, 1 and 100 μg/L) was initiated in adult fish and continued through hatching and the offspring generation for seven months. In addition to standard toxicological endpoints, induction of genotoxic effects and whole-genome transcriptome of liver samples of offspring generation of zebrafish were analysed. Exposure to IM did not affect the survival and growth of zebrafish, did not cause any histopathological changes, but it induced a marginal increase in the chromosomal damage in blood cells. The whole-genome transcriptome analyses demonstrated dose-dependent increase in the number of differentially expressed genes with a significantly higher number of deregulated genes in female fish compared to male. Differentially expressed genes included genes involved in response to DNA damage, cell cycle control and regulation of circadian rhythm. Based on the low genotoxic activity and the pattern of the changes in DNA damage responsive genes we consider that at current environmental exposure levels, IM represents low risk for genotoxic effects in aquatic organisms. Exposure to IM also induced deregulation of the expression of genes associated with steroidogenesis and hormone metabolism and function, which indicates hormone-disrupting activity of IM that has not been studied so far. The study provide new information on the potential consequences of chronic exposure to the residues of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which remain to be further explored.","

"Introduction:
        
      
      Analyses of secular trends in work-related fatal injury in New Zealand have previously only considered the total working population, potentially hiding trends for important subgroups of workers. This paper examines trends in work-related fatalities in worker subgroups between 2005 and 2014 to indicate where workplace safety action should be prioritised.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      A dataset of fatally injured workers was created; all persons aged 15-84 years, fatally injured in the period 2005-2014, were identified from mortality records, linked to coronial records which were then reviewed for work relatedness. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate annual percentage change in rates by age, sex, ethnicity, employment status, industry and occupation.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Overall, worker fatalities decreased by 2.4% (95% CI 0.0% to 4.6%) annually; an average reduction of 18 deaths per year from baseline (2005). Significant declines in annual rates were observed for younger workers (15-29 and 30-49 years), indigenous Māori, those in the public administration and service sector, and those in community and personal service occupations. Increases in annual rates occurred for workers in agriculture and forestry and fisheries sectors and for labourers. Rates of worker deaths in work-traffic settings declined faster than in workplace settings.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Discussion:
        
      
      Although overall age-standardised rates of work-related fatal injury have been declining, these trends were variable. Sources of injury risk in identifiable subgroups with increases in annual rates need to be urgently addressed. This study demonstrates the need for regular, detailed examination of the secular trends to identify those subgroups of workers requiring further workplace safety attention.","

"Distributions of 137Cs in dissolved and particulate phases of the downstream reaches of seven rivers and adjacent nearshore and offshore waters as far as ∼60 km south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) were studied during the high-river-flow period (June-September 2019) and during the period of October 2019 after typhoon Hagibis. Dissolved 137Cs activities in nearshore water were higher than those in rivers and offshore waters, and this distribution was more intensified after the typhoon, indicating the desorption of 137Cs from riverine suspended particles in addition to the ongoing release of contaminated water from the FDNPP and re-entry of radiocesium via submarine groundwater discharge. This scenario is also supported by the reduction of distribution coefficient (Kd) from a geometric mean value of 5.5 × 105 L/kg in rivers to 9.8 × 104 L/kg in nearshore water. The occupation of desorbed 137Cs to the dissolved activity of this nuclide in nearshore water was estimated to be 0.7%-20% (median: 9.7%) during the high-river-flow period, increasing to 1.4%-66% (32.3%) after the typhoon, suggesting that the desorption during the flood period such as typhoons further contributes to the increase in dissolved 137Cs levels in nearshore water.",,Suspended Particle-Water Interactions Increase Dissolved 137 Cs Activities in the Nearshore Seawater during Typhoon Hagibis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32786583/
"Shellfish production is an important activity for the economy of many countries. As well as its direct value, it helps to stabilize communities in rural areas characterized by limited job opportunities. It is also important for consumers who recognize shellfish as a healthy product that gains its nutrition from natural plankton without the need for fertilizers, chemical treatments or other anthropogenic intervention typical of terrestrial agriculture or other marine aquaculture. Nevertheless, global shellfish fisheries are under threat from harmful algal blooms (HABs) and related biotoxins, whose production is potentially exacerbated by global changes. This research provides evidence of economic impacts on Scottish shellfish farms in the last 10 years caused by HABs and their associated biotoxins. In contrast to previous approaches that have focused on variation in production as a function of temporal trends and blooms events, we use a production function approach to show which input factors (labour, capital, climate variables, concentration of biotoxins) have an effect on production. Results show that diarrhoetic shellfish toxins produced by the genera Dinophysis are most significant. A 1% change in the production of these biotoxins reduces shellfish production by 0.66%, with an average yearly negative variation in production of 15% (1,080 ton) and an economic loss (turnover) of £ (GBP) 1.37 m per year (in 2015 currency) over a national annual industry turnover of ~ £ 12 m. The production function approach is coupled with a multivariate time series model (VAR) capturing the statistical relationship between algal concentration, information on climatic variables and biotoxins to forecast the damage to shellfish production from HABs. This provides producers and regulators with the economic information to plan temporal and spatial mitigating measures necessary to limit damages to production by comparing the costs of these measures with the costs of lost production.",,"

      Fishery has always been perceived as a physically demanding industry of a manual character. In recent years the physical work environment has developed positively and consequently the current situation in not fully described in the existing literature. This study aims to describe the work environment of Danish fishermen with regard to their physical workload and ergonomic factors.

      A cross sectional study was performed on a random sample of active Danish commercial fishermen (response rate: 28%) by means of a questionnaire on demographic and self-reported occupational and health data. Questions covering the physical workload were related to seven different work situations and a score summing up the workload was developed for the analysis of the relative impact on different groups of fishermen.

      Almost all fishermen (96.2%) were familiar to proper lifting techniques but only 55.4% used them in their daily work. Standing work was the most applied work position (81.8%), while repetitive hand and finger movements and twisting and bending in the back were other frequent work situations. Deckhands had higher workload scores than skippers, while crew on Danish seiners had higher workload scores than fishermen in other vessel types.

      Despite improved work environment in the Danish fishing industry, fishermen still experience high levels of workload and suboptimal ergonomic conditions, which are known to cause pain and impair musculoskeletal health. To address the specific areas of fishing with the highest workload, future investments in assistive devices to ease the demanding work and reduce the workload, should particularly address deckhands and less mechanized vessels.","

"This survey aimed to evaluate the applicability of the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ) as a preliminary screening tool to investigate the presence of contact dermatological disorders in sea fishermen. The Italian version of the NOSQ was administered to 143 male fishermen working at an Apulia (Southern Italy) Fisheries, and 136 male workers who had never worked as sea fishers (controls). A significantly higher rate of frequency of transient itchy wheals on the hands, wrists, and forearms was recorded in the fishermen as compared to the controls (49.6% vs. 8.1%; p < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in the frequency of eczema (8.4% vs. 6.6%). In 46.1% of the fishermen, the onset of transient itchy wheals was associated with contact with specific agents and the most common causes were algae and aquatic plants (49.3%) and seabed sludge (25.3%). In conclusion, the administration of the NOSQ can be useful in preliminary screening for dermatitis in fishermen, although it could show a possible overestimation of the prevalence of transient itchy wheals.","

      Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a pathogen of importance for salmonid aquaculture. In this study, we aimed to characterize virus behavior and defense mechanisms developed in rainbow trout (RT, Oncorhynchus mykiss) experimentally infected with isolates belonging to the five described genotypes of IHNV, i.e. L, U, M, E and J. Mortality was monitored for two months, and blood and target organs were sampled at different times post-infection to assess viral load and cellular and humoral immune responses. Profiles of virulence were highly linked to precocious viral replication but also to the innate and specific immunity elicited in the host. Seroneutralization test (SNT) used for specific antibodies detection exhibited reliable results, with efficient cross-neutralization observed in heterologous systems except for the Asian representative. These data bring new insights about IHNV/RT interaction and reinforce the interest of SNT as preventive and epidemiological tool.

"Background:
        
      
      Human trafficking in the fishing industry or ""sea slavery"" in the Greater Mekong Subregion is reported to involve some of the most extreme forms of exploitation and abuse. A largely unregulated sector, commercial fishing boats operate in international waters far from shore and outside of national jurisdiction, where workers are commonly subjected to life-threatening risks. Yet, research on the health needs of trafficked fishermen is sparse. This paper describes abuses, occupational hazards, physical and mental health and post-trafficking well-being among a systematic consecutive sample of 275 trafficked fishermen using post-trafficking services in Thailand and Cambodia. These findings are complemented by qualitative interview data collected with 20 key informants working with fishermen or on issues related to their welfare in Thailand.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Men and boys trafficked for fishing (aged 12-55) were mainly from Cambodia (n = 217) and Myanmar (n = 55). Common physical health problems included dizzy spells (30.2%), exhaustion (29.5%), headaches (28.4%) and memory problems (24.0%). Nearly one-third (29.1%) reported pain in three or more areas of their body and one-quarter (26.9%) reported being in ""poor"" health. Physical health symptoms were strongly associated with: severe violence; injuries; engagement in long-haul fishing; immigration detention or symptoms of mental health disorders. Survivors were exposed to multiple work hazards and were perceived as disposable when disabled by illness or injuries. Employers struggled to apply internationally recommended Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) practices in Thailand. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) encountered challenges when trying to obtain healthcare for uninsured fishermen. Challenges included fee payment, service provision in native languages and officials siding with employers in disputes over treatment costs and accident compensation. Survivors' post-trafficking concerns included: money problems (75.9%); guilt and shame (33.5%); physical health (33.5%) and mental health (15.3%).

      Fishermen in this region are exposed to very serious risks to their health and safety, and their illnesses and injuries often go untreated. Men who enter the fishing industry in Thailand, especially migrant workers, require safe working conditions and targeted protections from human trafficking. Survivors of the crime of sea slavery must be provided with the compensation they deserve and the care they need, especially psychological support.","

"Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are typical endocrine disruptors found in common pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which are frequently detected in aquatic environments, especially surface water treated for drinking. However, current treatment technologies are inefficient for removing emerging endocrine disruptors, leading to the potential contamination of tap water. This study employed an optimized analytical method comprising solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) to detect APIs in tap water in Putrajaya, Malaysia. Several therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, including anti-inflammatory drugs (dexamethasone and diclofenac), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and triclosan), antiepileptics (primidone), antibacterial agents (ciprofloxacin), beta-blockers (propranolol), psychoactive stimulants (caffeine), and antiparasitic drugs (diazinon), were detected in the range of < 0.03 to 21.39 ng/L, whereas chloramphenicol (an antibiotic) was below the detection limit (< 0.23 ng/L). A comparison with global data revealed the spatial variability of emerging tap water pollutants. Diclofenac accounted for the highest concentration (21.39 ng/L), followed by triclosan and ciprofloxacin (9.74 ng/L and 8.69 ng/L, respectively). Caffeine was observed in all field samples with the highest distribution at 35.32%. Caffeine and triclosan exhibited significantly different distributions in household tap water (p < 0.05). Humans are exposed to these APIs by drinking the tap water; however, the estimated risk was negligible (risk quotient < 1). APIs are useful water quality monitoring indicators for water resource conservation and water supply safety related to emerging organic contaminants; thus, API detection is important for safeguarding the environment and human health.","

"As emerging pollutants, the occurrence and risks of organophosphate esters (OPEs) in mariculture farms should be concerned; however, information is limited. Beibu Gulf is one of the essential mariculture zones in China. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of OPEs in mariculture farms of the Beibu Gulf, their phase distribution and bioaccumulation among sediment, organisms (shrimp, crab, and oyster), water, and feed. Human exposure to OPEs through seafood consumption was also assessed. The total concentrations of the 11 target OPEs (∑11OPEs) in the water samples ranged 32.9-227 ng L-1. It was significantly higher in water from the culture ponds (mean 122 ng L-1) than in water from the estuaries and nearshore areas (mean 51.1 ng L-1) (nonparametric test, p < 0.05). ∑11OPEs in the feeds averaged 46.0 (range 21.7-84.5) ng g-1 dw, which is similar to the level in the organism samples (mean 55.5, range 21.3-138 ng g-1 dw) and 4.4 times higher than that in the sediment (mean 10.9, range 35-22.1 ng g-1 dw). The ∑11OPEs released from the feeds to the culture ponds was estimated to be 49 μg m-2 per three-month period. In the aquaculture ponds, the sediment-water distribution coefficient (log KOC), and the bioaccumulation factors from the water (log BWAFs) or the feed (log BFAFs) to the organisms, depend linearly on the hydrophobicity (log KOW) of OPEs. The log BWAFs and log BFAFs increased with increasing log KOW within the log KOW range of 1-7. The human exposure to OPEs through consumption of shrimp, crab, and oysters from the mariculture farms does not pose a health risk at present.","

      Holothurians are marine invertebrates also known as sea cucumbers. They are used in fresh or dried forms in various cuisines around the world and have alleged medicinal properties. Consequently, sea cucumbers, notably the orange-footed sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa)are increasingly harvested from the environment or farmed via aquaculture. We report three cases of unusual occupational exposure to C. frondosa resulting in cutaneous, respiratory and ocular irritating symptoms. These symptoms occurred as sea cucumbers were cut on half and eviscerated manually, following a machine breakdown in a sea cucumber processing factory. Given the composition of holothurians, these symptoms probably resulted from the aerosolization of various holothurins, saponins secreted by sea cucumbers as mean of defense. Treatment was solely symptomatic and included decontamination of the skin and the eyes, inhaled glucocorticoids, anticholinergic agents and oral glucocorticoids. As the exposure resulted from a machine breakdown, no specific protective equipment was put in place. Employees were advised not to handle manuallythe sea cucumbers in case such a breakdown was to happen again.

A total of 14 multiclass EDCs was detected in the drinking water supply system in Malaysia. Triclosan (an antimicrobial agent) and 4-octylphenol (a plasticizer) were only detected in the tap water (up to 9.74 and 0.44 ng/L, respectively). Meanwhile, chloramphenicol and 4-nonylphenol in the system were below the method detection limits. Bisphenol A was observed to be highest in tap water at 66.40 ng/L (detection: 100%; median concentration: 0.28 ng/L). There was a significant difference in triclosan contamination between the river and tap water (p < 0.001). Overall, the life groups were estimated at no possible risk of EDCs (risk quotient < 1).

We suggest that (1) governmental agencies provide the legal, regulatory, and management framework, but it is often the universities, conservation organizations, consultants, and the public that conduct the research and perform activities that lead to increased research and conservation efforts; (2) departments within agencies may have conflicting mandates, making it difficult to resolve differences in actions; (3) there is often conflict among and within state agencies and conservation organizations about roles and priorities; and (4) the role of the public is critical to ongoing research and conservation efforts. Identification of all the relevant stakeholders is necessary to recognizing competing claims, identifying the threats, deciding how to manage the threats, and enhancing population viability. Conflicts occur even within an agency when one department oversees science and protection of populations and another oversees and fosters an industry (aquaculture or fisheries, or permits for off-road vehicles). Conflicts also occur between resource agencies, industry, and conservation organizations. Recognizing the different stakeholders and their mandates, and encouraging participation in the process, leads to a better understanding of the threats, risks, and possible solutions when conflicts arise.

The southwest coastal region of Bangladesh, especially Assasuni Upazila of Satkhira District, is the most vulnerable to natural disasters and has faced notable changes in its LULC due to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic causes. The objectives of this study are to illustrate the temporal dynamics of LULC change in Assasuni Upazila over the last 27 years (i.e., between 1989 and 2015) and also to predict future land use change using CA-ANN (cellular automata and artificial neural network) model for the year 2028. Temporal dynamics of LULC change was analyzed, employing supervised classification of multi-temporal Landsat images. Then, prediction of future LULC was carried out by CA-ANN model using MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS. The analysis of LULC change revealed that the LULC of Assasuni had changed notably during 1989 to 2015. ""Bare lands"" decreased by 21% being occupied by other land uses, especially by ""shrimp farms."" Shrimp farm area increased by 25.9% during this period, indicating a major occupational transformation from agriculture to shrimp aquaculture in the study area during the period under study. Reduction in ""settlement"" area revealed the trend of migration from the Upazila. The predicted LULC for the year 2028 showed that reduction in bare land area would continue and 1595.97 ha bare land would transform into shrimp farm during 2015 to 2028. Also, the impacts of the changing LULC on the livelihood of local people and migration status of the Upazila were analyzed from the data collected through focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys. The analysis revealed that the changing LULC and the occupational shift from paddy cultivation to shrimp farming were related to each other. Around 31.3% of the total respondents stated that at least one of their family members had migrated. Climate-driven southwestern coastal people usually migrate from the vulnerable rural areas towards the nearest relatively safe city due to adverse effects of natural disasters. To control the unplanned development and reduce the internal migration in Assasuni and other coastal areas, a comprehensive land use management plan was suggested that would accommodate the diversified uses of coastal lands and eventually lessen the threats to the life and livelihood of the local people.","

Furthermore, they had more often been hospitalized due to diabetes mellitus, diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems as well as due to injury and poisoning. The risk for respiratory cancer and NHL among coastal fishermen exceeded that of deep sea fishermen, whereas the latter displayed a considerably higher SHR for diabetes mellitus, diseases of the respiratory system and metabolic and nutritional disorders. In contrast, the SHR for hypertensive and ischemic heart diseases was decreased among deep sea fishermen. Less qualified deep sea fishermen displayed a considerably higher SHR for malignant neoplasms at all sites than more highly qualified ones.

"The African catfish Clarias gariepinus has a genetic sex determination system in which high temperature induces masculinization. The thermosensitive period for sex differentiation is short and occurs very early (from 6 to 8 days posthatching [dph]). As young juveniles can encounter high masculinizing temperature (36.5°C) in African water points, we aimed to determine the thermal preference of sexually undifferentiated juveniles and investigate if they spontaneously move toward high masculinizing temperature. Experiments were carried out in an environmental continuum (28-28-28°C and 28-32-36.5°C) made up of three 50-L aquariums connected together. Four hundred larvae from 10 different full-sib progenies were reared successively from 2 to 14 dph in these facilities. Before and after thermal treatments, fish were reared at 28°C until sex ratio determination at 70 dph. In the control continuum, fish were nearly equally distributed in the three compartments. Conversely, in the thermal continuum, compartment occupation significantly differed with progeny and period. During the highly thermosensitive period, two of five progenies significantly preferred (54.7% and 39.8% occupation) the 36.5°C compartment. All tested progenies reared in thermal continuum and separated 36.5°C aquarium showed a skewed sex ratio toward the male phenotype (78-100%). Nevertheless, no correlation was found between 36.5°C compartment occupation and sex ratio in thermal continuum groups. As masculinization temperature could be encountered in African water points during the spawning season, we discussed the adaptive advantage for the African catfish to display a sex differentiation process controlled by a temperature effect.",,"

"We examined occupational and industrial differences in lung, gastric, and colorectal cancer risk among Japanese men of working age (25-64 years) using the 2010 Japanese national survey data for occupation and industry-specific death rates. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the age-adjusted incident rate ratios by lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers, with manufacturing used as the referent occupation or industry. Unemployed Japanese men and those in manufacturing had an 8-11-fold increased risk of lung, gastric and colorectal cancer. The highest mortality rates for lung and colorectal cancer by occupation were ""administrative and managerial"" (by occupation) and ""mining"" (by industry). For gastric cancer, the highest mortality rate was ""agriculture"" (by occupation) and ""mining"" (by industry). By occupation; Japanese men in service occupations, those in administrative and managerial positions, those in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and those in professional and engineering categories had higher relative mortality risks for lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers. By industry; mining, electricity and gas, fisheries, and agriculture and forestry had the higher mortality risks for those cancers. Unemployed men had higher mortality rates than men in any occupation and industry for all three cancers.

"The integration of citizen scientists into ecological research is transforming how, where, and when data are collected, and expanding the potential scales of ecological studies. Citizen-science projects can provide numerous benefits for participants while educating and connecting professionals with lay audiences, potentially increasing the acceptance of conservation and management actions. However, for all the benefits, collection of citizen-science data is often biased towards areas that are easily accessible (e.g. developments and roadways), and thus data are usually affected by issues typical of opportunistic surveys (e.g. uneven sampling effort). These areas are usually illuminated by artificial light at night (ALAN), a dynamic sensory stimulus that alters the perceptual world for both humans and wildlife. Our goal was to test whether satellite-based measures of ALAN could improve our understanding of the detection process of citizen-scientist-reported sightings of a large mammal. We collected observations of American black bears Ursus americanus (n = 1,315) outside their primary range in Minnesota, USA, as part of a study to gauge population expansion. Participants from the public provided sighting locations of bears on a website. We used an occupancy modelling framework to determine how well ALAN accounted for observer metrics compared to other commonly used metrics (e.g. housing density). Citizen scientists reported 17% of bear sightings were under artificially lit conditions and monthly ALAN estimates did the best job accounting for spatial bias in detection of all observations, based on AIC values and effect sizes ( β ^  = 0.81, 0.71-0.90 95% CI). Bear detection increased with elevated illuminance; relative abundance was positively associated with natural cover, proximity to primary bear range and lower road density. Although the highest counts of bear sightings occurred in the highly illuminated suburbs of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan region, we estimated substantially higher bear abundance in another region with plentiful natural cover and low ALAN (up to ~375% increased predicted relative abundance) where observations were sparse. We demonstrate the importance of considering ALAN radiance when analysing citizen-scientist-collected data, and we highlight the ways that ALAN data provide a dynamic snapshot of human activity.","

      In the recent decades, rare earth elements (REE) have undergone a steady spread in several industrial and medical applications, and in agriculture. Relatively scarce information has been acquired to date on REE-associated biological effects, from studies of bioaccumulation and of bioassays on animal, plant and models; a few case reports have focused on human health effects following occupational REE exposures, in the present lack of epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed groups. The literature is mostly confined to reports on few REE, namely cerium and lanthanum, whereas substantial information gaps persist on the health effects of other REE. An established action mechanism in REE-associated health effects relates to modulating oxidative stress, analogous to the recognized redox mechanisms observed for other transition elements. Adverse outcomes of REE exposures include a number of endpoints, such as growth inhibition, cytogenetic effects, and organ-specific toxicity. An apparent controversy regarding REE-associated health effects relates to opposed data pointing to either favorable or adverse effects of REE exposures. Several studies have demonstrated that REE, like a number of other xenobiotics, follow hormetic concentration-related trends, implying stimulatory or protective effects at low levels, then adverse effects at higher concentrations. Another major role for REE-associated effects should be focused on pH-dependent REE speciation and hence toxicity. Few reports have demonstrated that environmental acidification enhances REE toxicity; these data may assume particular relevance in REE-polluted acidic soils and in REE mining areas characterized by concomitant REE and acid pollution. The likely environmental threats arising from REE exposures deserve a new line of research efforts.

"The aim of this study is to understand the role that the movement patterns of pigs, cattle and buffalo play in the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). A cross-sectional survey consisting of a questionnaire was used in a hotspot area for FMD: Xayabouli Province, Lao People's Democratic Republic. A total of 189 respondents were interviewed. We found that the key players in this network were people who were involved with more than one species of animal or occupation (multipurpose occupational node), which represents the highest number of activities of animals moved off the holding (shown with the highest out-degree centrality) and a high likelihood of being an intermediary between others (shown with the highest betweenness centrality). Moreover, the results show that the animals moved to and away from each node had few connections. Some nodes (such as traders) always received animals from the same group of cattle owners at different times. The subgroup connection within this network has many weak components, which means a connection in this network shows that some people can be reached by others, but most people were not. In this way, the number of connections present in the network was low when we defined the proportion of observed connections with all possible connections (density). These findings indicate that the network might not be busy; only one type of node is dominant which enables increased control of disease spread. We recommend that the relevant authorities implement control measures regarding the key players, which is the best way to effectively control the spread of infectious diseases.","

"Myrmecochory is a widespread mutualism in which plants benefit from seed dispersal services by ants. Ants might also be providing seeds with an additional byproduct benefit via reduced plant pathogen loads in the ant nest environment through their antimicrobial glandular secretions. We investigate this byproduct benefit by identifying fungal communities in ant nests and surrounding environments and quantifying fungal community change (1) through time, (2) between different nest substrates, and (3) as a function of average ant activity levels within nests (based on observed ant activity at nest entrances throughout the summer). We split fungal communities by functional guild to determine seed-dispersing ant-induced changes in the overall fungal community, the animal pathogen fungal community, the plant pathogen fungal community, and the myrmecochore pathogen fungal community. Nest substrate (soil or log) explained much of the variation in fungal community dissimilarity, while substrate occupation (ant nest or control sample) and time had no influence on fungal community composition. Average ant activity had no effect on the community turnover in fungal communities except for the myrmecochore pathogenic fungal community. In this community, higher ant activity throughout the summer resulted in more fluctuation in the pathogenic community in the ant nest. Our results are not consistent with a byproduct benefit framework in myrmecochory, but suggest that nest substrate drives dissimilarity in fungal communities. The influence of nest substrate on fungal communities has important implications for seeds taken into ant nests, as well as ant nest location choice by queens and during nest relocation.","

"We have recently argued that, because microbes have pervasive - often vital - influences on our lives, and that therefore their roles must be taken into account in many of the decisions we face, society must become microbiology-literate, through the introduction of relevant microbiology topics in school curricula (Timmis et al. 2019. Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.",,"

"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the main cause of human viral encephalitis in Asia, with a mortality rate reaching 30%, mostly affecting children. The traditionally described cycle involving wild birds as reservoirs, pigs as amplifying hosts and Culex mosquitoes as vectors is questioned, with increasing evidence of a more complex multi-host system involved in areas where densities of pigs are low, such as in Cambodia. In 2018, we examined pigs, chickens, ducks and dogs from Kandal province, Cambodia, for antibody response against JEV by hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization assays. Forces of infection (FOI) for flaviviruses and JEV were estimated per species and per unit of body surface area (BSA). JEV seroprevalence reached 31% (95% CI: 23-41%) in pigs, 1% (95% CI: 0.1-3%) in chickens, 12% (95% CI: 7-19%) in ducks and 35% (95% CI: 28-42%) in dogs. Pigs were most likely to be infected (FOI: 0.09 per month), but the FOI was higher in ducks than in pigs for a given BSA (ratio of 0.13). Dogs had a lower FOI than ducks but a higher FOI than chickens (0.01 per month). For a given BSA, dogs were less likely to be infected than pigs (ratio of 1.9). In Cambodia, the virus may be circulating between multiple hosts. Dogs live in close contact with humans, and estimating their exposure to JEV infection could be a relevant indicator of the risk for humans to get infected, which is poorly known due to underdiagnosis. Understanding the JEV cycle and developing tools to quantify the exposure of humans is essential to adapt and support control measures for this vaccine-preventable disease.","

In low-income countries, brucellosis is an endemic and neglected disease affecting both animals and humans. This study was intended to establish brucellosis sero-prevalence among patients attending Wau hospital, South Sudan. Across sectional study, was done among randomly selected patients attending Wau hospital. Data was collected using questionnaires and laboratory investigations. Rose Bengal plate Test (RBPT), Serum agglutination test (SAT) and Competitive Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (c-ELISA) was used in the analysis of blood samples serially starting with RBPT which is more sensitive and least specific then SAT. c-ELISA test which is most specific and less sensitive compared to RBPT and SAT was then used to confirm presence of Brucella antibodies in the samples. A total of 416 participants out of 1664 were enrolled to this study. The majority of participants were between 7-to-76 years of age with mean age of 30.72 (SD+/- 12.83).

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of high-fat (HF) and cafeteria diet (CAF) diets and sex on the metabolism of important fatty acids in the liver and perirenal fat tissue. Dietary treatments induced changes in the fatty acid profile in comparison to the untreated group, but the characteristic differences between treated groups were also observable. The HF diet induced an increase in the content of C16:1n-7 and C18:1n-7 in the liver phospholipids (PL) and triglycerides (TG) and perirenal fat tissue compared to the control and CAF diet. The CAF diet induced a more drastic decrease in both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including depletion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The CAF diet also increased the content of n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-6) in the liver and decreased it in the perirenal fat. Sex also had a significant influence on the fatty acid profile, but the variables with the highest differences between the CAF and HF treatments were identical in the male and female rats. In this study, we have established that two dietary models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) led to characteristic changes in the hepatic and perirenal fat fatty acid profile, in contrast to the control diet and in comparison with each other. These differences could play an important role in the interpretation of the experimental results of nutritional studies.","

"The objective of this study was to inform efforts to reduce risk for musculoskeletal disorders among commercial lobstermen by characterizing and quantifying injuries that occur to people while harvesting lobsters commercially in the Northeast United States. This study aimed to estimate a denominator of exposure to lobstering in full-time equivalents (FTE), to estimate a fatality rate, and to calculate incidence rates for acute injuries within the sample population. Captains were randomly selected from those licensed to fish in Maine and Massachusetts. Data on work exposure and injuries with rapid onset that occurred on the boat (""acute injuries"") were collected using a survey, which was administered quarterly via phone or face-to-face interview with the captain. The quarterly survey assessed the number of weeks worked during the quarter, average crew size, number of trips per week, and average trip length in hours. In addition, this survey captured relevant information (body segment affected, type of injury, and whether treatment was received) on all acute injuries occurring during the quarter. FTE were estimated using fishermen days and fishermen hours. The annual FTE estimated using days was 2,557 and using hours was 2,855. As expected, the summer months (3rd quarter) had the highest FTE and the winter (1st quarter) the lowest FTE. Fall (4th quarter) and spring (2nd quarter) ranked second and third, respectively. The incidence rates for all injuries (49.7/100 FTE) and injuries requiring treatment (15.0/100 FTE) were much higher than those reported in other studies of fishing that used Coast Guard data.","

"An adverse tendency induced by the environmental estrogens in female reproductive health is one serious problem worldwide. Diethylstilbestrol (DES), as a synthetic estrogen, is still used as an animal growth stimulant in terrestrial livestock and aquaculture illegally. It has been reported to negatively affect ovarian function and oogenesis. Nevertheless, the mechanism and toxicity of DES on oocyte meiotic maturation are largely unknown. Herein, we found that DES (40 μM) intervened in mouse oocyte maturation and first polar body extrusion (PBE) was decreased in vitro. Cell cycle analysis showed meiotic process was disturbed with oocytes arrested at metaphase I (MI) stage after DES exposure. Further study showed that DES exposure disrupted the spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, which then continuously provoke the spindle assemble checkpoint (SAC). We also observed that the acetylation levels of α-tubulin were dramatically increased in DES-treated oocytes. In addition, the dynamics of actin were also affected. Moreover, the distribution patterns of estrogen receptor α (ERα) were altered in DES-treated oocyte, as indicated by the significant signals accumulation in the spindle area. However, ERα inhibitor failed to rescue the defects of oocyte maturation caused by DES. Of note, the same phenomenon was observed in estrogen-treated oocytes. Collectively, we showed that DES exposure lead to the oocyte meiotic failure via impairing the spindle assembly and chromosome alignment. Our research is helpful to understand how environmental estrogen affects female germ cells and contribute to design the potential therapies to preserve fertility especially for occupational exposure.","

"The objectives of the current study were to determine the occupational health hazards posed by the application of pesticides in rice-prawn concurrent systems of south-west Bangladesh and to assess their potential risks for the aquatic ecosystems that support the culture of freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). Information on pesticide use in rice-prawn farming was collected through structured interviews with 38 farm owners held between January and May of 2012. The risks of the pesticide use to human health were assessed through structured interviews. The TOXSWA model was used to calculate pesticide exposure (peak and time-weighted average concentrations) in surface waters of rice-prawn systems for different spray drift scenarios and a simple first tier risk assessment based on threshold concentrations derived from single species toxicity tests were used to assess the ecological risk in the form of risk quotients. The PERPEST model was used to refine the ecological risks when the first tier assessment indicated a possible risk. Eleven synthetic insecticides and one fungicide (sulphur) were recorded as part of this investigation. The most commonly reported pesticide was sulphur (used by 29% of the interviewed farmers), followed by thiamethoxam, chlorantraniliprole, and phenthoate (21%). A large portion of the interviewed farmers described negative health symptoms after pesticide applications, including vomiting (51%), headache (18%) and eye irritation (12%). The results of the first tier risk assessment indicated that chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, and malathion may pose a high to moderate acute and chronic risks for invertebrates and fish in all evaluated spray drift scenarios. The higher tier assessment using the PERPEST model confirmed the high risk of cypermethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, and chlorpyrifos for insects and macro- and micro-crustaceans thus indicating that these pesticides may have severe adverse consequences for the prawn production yields.","

In addition, participants with an arrest history had higher odds of injection use (OR 19.58, 95 % CI: 9.81-39.10, p < 0.001) and risky injection drug use (OR 16.25, 95 % CI: 4.73-55.85, p < 0.001). Participants with depression had significantly higher odds of engaging in risky injection drug use behavior (OR 3.26, 95 % 1.39-7.67, p = 0.007). Focusing on participants with a history of injection drug use, we found that participants with depression were significantly more likely to engage in risky drug use compared to participants below the depression cutoff (OR 3.45, 95 % CI: 1.23-9.66, p < 0.02).

      Hookah diving is a fishing method used in many small-scale fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, as well as in many coastal fisheries around the world. Many high-value species like sea cucumber and spiny lobster, among others, are harvested via hookah diving. However, the fishing method presents a risk for both decompression illness and carbon monoxide poisoning, both causes of disabilities and death among small-scale fishers, and with significant negative impacts on the social and economic status of households and coastal communities. Currently, there is a misunderstanding among fishers concerning diving risks. Using a mixed-method analysis, this study reports the risk perceptions of small-scale fishers and hyperbaric personnel about hookah diving, and the actual diving accidents which occur in the spiny lobster and sea cucumber fisheries in the Yucatán northeastern ports. The study highlights the need for appropriate fishing technologies and increased awareness among fishers about the consequences of hookah diving. Fishery managers and health services can make priority decisions based on the information generated.

"The objective of this paper is to compare food consumption by Cambodian garment workers with and without access to a free model lunch provision through a factory-based canteen. Data from an exploratory randomised controlled trial were analysed. In total, 223 female Cambodian garment workers were allocated to an intervention arm (six-month lunch provision) or a control arm. Dietary intake on workdays was assessed by qualitative 24-h recalls at baseline and twice at follow-ups during the period of lunch provision using the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) guideline on assessing women's dietary diversity. In total, 158 participants provided complete data on the dietary intake over workdays at all interviews. Lunch provision resulted in a more frequent consumption of dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), vitamin A-rich fruits, other fruits, and oils and fats during lunch breaks. In contrast, flesh meats, legumes, nuts and seeds, as well as sweets, were eaten at a lower frequency. Except for a higher consumption rate of vitamin A-rich fruits and a lower intake frequency of sweets, lunch provision had a less clear impact on total 24-h intake from different food groups and was not associated with a higher women's dietary diversity score (WDDS). A more gap-oriented design of the lunch sets taking into account underutilised foods and the nutritional status of the workers is recommended.","

"Both animal study and epidemiological survey revealed the associations between defects of cognitive function and the developmental exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), while the mechanism is not well known. The SD rats were exposed PFOS at 1.7, 5 and 15 mg/L by drinking water from gestation to the adulthood of the pups for evaluating the effects of PFOS exposure on long-term potentiation (LTP) and the role of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors trafficking. Whole-life exposure of PFOS beginning in utero to adulthood significantly inhibited the induction and expression of LTP, and the input/output curve (I/O) and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) were moderately suppressed, suggesting that PFOS might affect the synaptic transmission and plasticity both in pre- and post-synaptic cells. Meanwhile, PFOS decreased the mRNA levels of AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, and the protein amounts in the membrane, with the total GluA1 and GluA2 protein amounts increased, indicating the internalization of AMPA receptors. Furthermore, tests in the primary hippocampal neurons also support the decreased mRNA levels of GluA1 and GluA2 induced by PFOS. After the pretreatment of AMPA antagonist (NBQX), PFOS decreased the expression of GluA1 and GluA2 and increased internal cellular calcium at much lower levels than that in the neurons without NBQX treatment. The results provide electrophysiological evidence for the impaired cognitive function induced by PFOS exposure and revealed the critical role of AMPA receptor involved.","Keywords:

      The use of 'map-like' information from the Earth's magnetic field for orientation has been shown in diverse taxa, but questions remain regarding the function of such maps. We used a 'magnetic displacement' experiment to demonstrate that juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) use magnetic cues to orient. The experiment was designed to simultaneously explore whether their magnetic map is used to direct fish (i) homeward, (ii) toward the center of their broad oceanic range or (iii) along their oceanic migratory route. The headings adopted by these navigationally naive fish coincided remarkably well with the direction of the juveniles' migration inferred from historical tagging and catch data. This suggests that the large-scale movements of pink salmon across the North Pacific may be driven largely by their innate use of geomagnetic map cues. Key aspects of the oceanic ecology of pink salmon and other marine migrants might therefore be predicted from magnetic displacement experiments.

"Maitotoxins (MTXs) are among the most potent toxins known. These toxins are produced by epi-benthic dinoflagellates of the genera Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa and may play a role in causing the symptoms associated with Ciguatera Fish Poisoning. A recent survey revealed that, of the species tested, the newly described species from the Canary Islands, G. excentricus, is one of the most maitotoxic. The goal of the present study was to characterize MTX-related compounds produced by this species. Initially, lysates of cells from two Canary Island G. excentricus strains VGO791 and VGO792 were partially purified by (i) liquid-liquid partitioning between dichloromethane and aqueous methanol followed by (ii) size-exclusion chromatography. Fractions from chromatographic separation were screened for MTX toxicity using both the neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2a) cytotoxicity and Ca2+ flux functional assays. Fractions containing MTX activity were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to pinpoint potential MTX analogs. Subsequent non-targeted HRMS analysis permitted the identification of a novel MTX analog, maitotoxin-4 (MTX4, accurate mono-isotopic mass of 3292.4860 Da, as free acid form) in the most toxic fractions. HRMS/MS spectra of MTX4 as well as of MTX are presented. In addition, crude methanolic extracts of five other strains of G. excentricus and 37 other strains representing one Fukuyoa species and ten species, one ribotype and one undetermined strain/species of Gambierdiscus were screened for the presence of MTXs using low resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LRMS/MS). This targeted analysis indicated the original maitotoxin (MTX) was only present in one strain (G. australes S080911_1). Putative maitotoxin-2 (p-MTX2) and maitotoxin-3 (p-MTX3) were identified in several other species, but confirmation was not possible because of the lack of reference material. Maitotoxin-4 was detected in all seven strains of G. excentricus examined, independently of their origin (Brazil, Canary Islands and Caribbean), and not detected in any other species. MTX4 may therefore serve as a biomarker for the highly toxic G. excentricus in the Atlantic area.","Keywords:

"Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer. We posit that rights-based fisheries management (the individual allocation of fishing quota to vessels or fishing entities, also called catch shares) can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish experienced in fisheries around the world. The competitive nature of such fisheries results in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance. Although not necessarily intended to address safety issues, catch shares eliminate many of the economic incentives to fish as rapidly as possible. We develop a dataset and methods to empirically evaluate the effects of the adoption of catch shares management on a particularly risky type of behavior: the propensity to fish in stormy weather. After catch shares was implemented in an economically important US West Coast fishery, a fisherman's probability of taking a fishing trip in high wind conditions decreased by 82% compared with only 31% in the former race to fish fishery. Overall, catch shares caused the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days to decrease by 79%. These results are evidence that institutional changes can significantly reduce individual, voluntary risk exposure and result in safer fisheries.","

Risk assessment showed that 95% upper confidence limits of the hazard index (HI) of organotins were almost all over 1, indicating that there are probability of health impacts for organotin consumption in Taiwanese consumers. Those who consume higher amounts of seafood and fishery may be at a higher risk of health issues, but the data indicate that organotin levels have become controlled in recent years as compared with health risk data published in 2006.","

"Introduction:
        
      
      During 2000-2011, 35 injuries (8 fatal) involving winches were reported to the Coast Guard in the Southern shrimp fleet. Injuries involving the main winch drums had a higher risk for fatal outcomes compared to injuries involving the winch cathead (RR=7.5; 1.1-53.7). The objective of this study was to design effective solutions to protect deckhands from entanglement hazards posed by winches found on the vessels in the Southern shrimp fleet.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      Based on injury characteristics, site visit observations, and input from vessel owners, NIOSH determined that the design and implementation of effective main-winch guarding was a feasible first-step in mitigating the entanglement hazard. Design considerations for stationary guards favor systems that are simple, affordable, durable, unobtrusive, and will not interfere with normal fishing operations. In addition, an auxiliary-stop method was tested to prevent entanglements in try-net winches.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      Standardized passive guards were designed for three commonly found main winch models. Initial prototype guards have been sea-tested. The design of six additional guards is underway, for a total of three iterations for each winch model identified. These will incorporate features found to be valued by fishermen, will be more efficient, and will reduce the overall cost of fabrication and maintenance. Sea testing of these iterations continues. The auxiliary-stop circuit control prototype system was designed to prevent entanglements in the try-net winch and is currently being sea tested.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Discussion:
        
      
      NIOSH has completed initial designs for stationary-winch guards. Through collaborations with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested winch guard and auxiliary stop designs will be made available to qualified welders and craftsmen to use. This approach has proven effective in preventing other types of winch injuries.

"When the Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew out in 2010, the immediate threats to productive deep water and estuarial fisheries and the region's fishing and energy economies were obvious. Less immediately obvious, but equally unsettling, were risks to human health posed by potential damage to the regional food web. This paper describes grassroots and regional efforts by the Gulf Coast Health Alliance: health risks related to the Macondo Spill Fishermen's Citizen Science Network project. Using a community-based participatory research approach and a citizen science structure, the multiyear project measured exposure to petrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, researched the toxicity of these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and communicated project findings and seafood consumption guidelines throughout the region (coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama).

"The advantages of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been well established. However, the molecular mechanisms of the anti-diabetic action of MUFAs remain unclear. This study examined the anti-hyperglycemic effect and explored the molecular mechanisms involved in the actions of fish oil- rich in MUFAs that had been acquired from hybrid catfish (Pangasius larnaudii×Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) among experimental type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetic rats that were fed with fish oil (500 and 1,000 mg/kg BW) for 12 weeks significantly reduced the fasting plasma glucose levels without increasing the plasma insulin levels. The diminishing levels of plasma lipids and the muscle triglyceride accumulation as well as the plasma leptin levels were identified in T2DM rats, which had been administrated with fish oil. Notably, the plasma adiponectin levels increased among these rats. The fish oil supplementation also improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic histological changes. Moreover, the supplementation of fish oil improved insulin signaling (p-AktSer473 and p-PKC-ζ/λThr410/403), p-AMPKThr172 and membrane GLUT4 protein expressions, whereas the protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and nuclear NF-κB) as well as p-PKC-θThr538 were down regulated in the skeletal muscle. These data indicate that the effects of fish oil-rich in MUFAs in these T2DM rats were partly due to the attenuation of insulin resistance and an improvement in the adipokine imbalance. The mechanisms of the anti-hyperglycemic effect are involved in the improvement of insulin signaling, AMPK activation, GLUT4 translocation and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine protein expressions.","Keywords:

"Diving as a method of fishing is used worldwide in small-scale fisheries. However, one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among fishermen is decompression sickness (DCS). We report the case of a 46-year-old male fisherman diver who presented with chronic inguinal pain that radiated to the lower left limb. Living and working in a fishing port in Yucatan, he had a prior history of DCS. A diagnosis of avascular necrosis in the left femoral head secondary to DCS was made via analysis of clinical and radiological findings. The necrosis was surgically resolved by a total hip arthroplasty. Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a more probable diagnosis. In this region fishermen undergo significant decompression stress in their daily fishing efforts. Further studies regarding prevalence of dysbaric osteonecrosis among small-scale fisheries divers are needed. In a community where DCS is endemic and has become an epidemic, as of late, the perception of this health risk remains low. Furthermore, training and decompression technique are lacking among the fishing communities.","

"Introduction:
        
      
      Fishing is an occupation associated with uneven diet, strain, drunkenness, tobacco use, and deleterious habits. The physical state of laborers on a large scale will also be influenced by conditions at their work site. Oral mucosal lesions can occur as a result of infections, local shock or infuriation, systemic diseases, and uncontrolled usage of tobacco, betel quid, and alcohol. The aim of the present study is to assess the prevalence of deleterious oral habits and oral mucosal lesions among fishermen population of Mahe, South India.

No evidence of vitamin A or vitamin B12 deficiency was found. Body mass index was associated with serum ferritin (negative) and serum retinol-binding protein (positive) concentrations, but not strongly. A comparison between underweight and not underweight workers resulted in distinctions for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, with a higher prevalence among not underweight.

      The prevalence of underweight, anemia and poor iron status was high. Young and nulliparous female garment workers in Cambodia might constitute a group with elevated risk for nutritional deficiencies. Strategies need to be developed for improving their nutritional, micronutrient and health status. The poor iron status seems to contribute to the overall prevalence of anemia. Low hemoglobin and iron deficiency affected both underweight and those not underweight. Despite the fact that body mass index was negatively associated with iron stores, true differences in iron status between underweight and not underweight participants cannot be confirmed.","Keywords:

The present study aimed at monitoring and assessing the ecological quality of Aghlagan river, northwest of Iran, using integrated physicochemical-biological approaches. A total of 14,423 samplings were carried out from the headwater to downstream sites at four stations (S1, 2, 3, 4) by a Surber sampler (30 cm × 30 cm) from June 2018 to April 2019. The results obtained from macroinvertebrate biotic index revealed that the genera of Gammarus (Amphipoda) and Baetis (Ephemeroptera) were the most abundant in all seasons. The PAST software was applied to analyze the diversity indices (Shannon-Weiner diversity, Evenness, and Simpson indices). Based on the cluster analysis, S3 established the least similarity to other stations. The average frequency of each macroinvertebrate species was determined by one-factor analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). In accordance with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), temperature and phosphate were found as the dominant factors effecting the macroinvertebrate assemblage and distribution. Moreover, the results obtained from the biological indices concluded very good quality of S4 by Helsinhoff and EPT indices and fair quality using BMWP index. The data on the macrobenthos assemblage and dynamics in the Aghlagan river across a hydraulic gradient provided useful information on water management efforts that assist us to find sustainable solutions for the enhanced quality of the river by balancing environmental and human values.","

We conducted a case-control study on 31 cases and 63 controls. Multivariate analysis pointed to cooked yellowfin tuna fillet as the very likely source of food poisoning (odds ratio = 156.8; 95% confidence interval: 18.4-1,338.4). The fresh yellowfin tuna was from Reunion Island and was supplied vacuum-sealed and packed with ice at the principal food market of Paris. No cold chain issues could be established in the upstream and downstream supply chains. Histamine concentration was found to be 1,720 mg/kg in leftover raw tuna, and 3,720 mg/kg in control cooked tuna, well above the threshold limit values defined by European regulations (200 mg/kg). The presence of Klebsiella variicola and Pantoea agglomerans, microorganisms of the Enterobacterales order that have been reported to produce histamine, was confirmed in the leftover raw tuna. This type of food poisoning is rarely recognised and confirmed. We describe the outbreak to highlight the specific key points of this type of investigation.","

      Mortality rates from accidents while working at sea remain high in the British fishing industry. Over the twentieth century there has been a progressive fall in the numbers of deaths, much of this relates to changes in fishing methods and in the types of vessels used. However in recent years, and with a fleet of smaller vessels, the mortality rates from accidents have shown little change and a larger proportion of deaths than in the past have arisen from personal injuries and drowning as compared to vessel losses. Disease makes a relatively small contribution to mortality at sea and this has dwindled with the decline in distant water fishing. Suicide and homicide both feature in a small way, but rates cannot readily be compared with those ashore.

      Mortality rates from accidents while working at sea remain high in the British fishing industry. Over the twentieth century there has been a progressive fall in the numbers of deaths, much of this relates to changes in fishing methods and in the types of vessels used. However in recent years, and with a fleet of smaller vessels, the mortality rates from accidents have shown little change and a larger proportion of deaths than in the past have arisen from personal injuries and drowning as compared to vessel losses. Disease makes a relatively small contribution to mortality at sea and this has dwindled with the decline in distant water fishing. Suicide and homicide both feature in a small way, but rates cannot readily be compared with those ashore.

"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for analyzing and comparing environmental impacts of products throughout their life cycles, facilitating shifts towards more environmentally friendly products. However, LCA does currently not address terrestrial biodiversity impacts related to the conversion of terrestrial habitat into aquatic habitat. This conversion can occur because of sea level rise, establishment of new land-based aquaculture, as well as reservoir expansion or creation. Here, we focus on land occupation and terrestrial biodiversity impacts, while transformation impacts, and habitat gain for aquatic species were beyond the scope of the study. To be able to estimate the regional and global terrestrial biodiversity impacts of future land occupation from terrestrial to aquatic habitat in LCA, we developed new characterization factors (CFs) for 781 terrestrial ecoregions, 5 land cover/use types, and 4 taxonomic groups. The basis for the development of the proposed CFs is the model concept of the currently recommended method for quantifying land use impacts on biodiversity in LCA by the Life Cycle Initiative hosted by United Nations Environmental Program. The global CFs vary between 7.44 E-20 PDF/m2 and 6.25 E-09 PDF/m2, showing that a highly variable terrestrial biodiversity impact of land inundation between land cover/use types, taxonomic groups and ecoregions exists.","

"Brucellosis, one of the most common zoonotic diseases and has significant public health and economic importance worldwide. Few studies and reports have been performed to estimate the true prevalence of animal brucellosis in the Sultanate of Oman; however, no incidence of the disease was previously reported in Al Jabal Al Akhdar. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of brucellosis in goats in eight villages in Al Jebal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman, namely: Al Aqaieb, Al Helailat, Al Ghilayil, Hail Al Hedap, Da'an Al Hamra, Shnoot, Al Qasha'e and Al Sarah, Al Jabal Al Akhdar in the Sultanate of Oman. In this study we used different diagnostic serological tests, namely, RBT, I-ELISA and CFT to study the prevalence of Brucella infection in goats in Al Jabal Al Akhdar. Statistical analysis using Kappa statistics was used to compare the performance of the serological tests. Biochemical tests and species-specific Multiplex PCR were used to identify the brucella species involved in the infection. A structured questionnaire and Chi-square (x2 ) statistical analysis was used to identify related brucellosis risk factors. This study is the first to reveal brucellosis infection in goats in eight villages in Al Jebal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman, namely: Al Aqaieb, Al Helailat, Al Ghilayil, Hail Al Hedap, Da'an Al Hamra, Shnoot, Al Qasha'e and Al Sarah, with an overall seroprevalence of 11.1%. The study also compared the performance of three different serological tests, namely, RBT, I-ELISA and CFT. Statistical analysis using Kappa statistics showed that the degree of agreement was best seen between RBT and CFT (96%), followed by RBT, I- ELISA (91.4%) and CFT and I- ELISA (89.2%). Biochemical tests and species-specific Multiplex PCR showed the typical profile for B. melitensis. A structured questionnaire and Chi-square (x2 ) statistical analysis indicated that the presence of abortion is the major risk factor for the prevalence of brucellosis, whereas age and sex were not significant factors in the tested animals. Besides, poor knowledge about brucellosis, consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products, free trade of animals and the introduction of new animal breeds to herds were all contributing risk factors to the prevalence of brucellosis. The prevalence of human brucellosis obtained verbally from pastoralists gave an insight that brucellosis could pose a public health hazard, especially in those high-risk groups, mainly the pastoralists in the study area. Because of their constant and increasing interaction with their animals, pastoralists could be at a high risk of occupational infection.","

"Diving fisheries are an important source of income and protein for many coastal communities around the world. However, these fisheries are also the cause of both fatal and non-fatal injuries. The aim of this study is to estimate the costs of decompression sickness (DCS) in the diving small-scale fisheries that target benthic resources in the Yucatan, Mexico. The DCS cases that occurred during three fishing seasons for sea cucumber (Isostichopus badionotus) and one for spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) were used to calculate the direct medical costs. The catch data during the same fishing seasons were used to calculate the potential losses caused by disability as indirect costs. In the three years (from 2013 to 2016) the total number of fishermen treated in the region numbered 282; 116 during lobster fishing and 166 during sea cucumber season. The direct medical costs were estimated to be USD $120,269; the temporary loss of income in USD $724,377; and the permanent loss of income was USD $737,053. Considering the direct and indirect costs, the social costs of diving in both small-scale fisheries was USD $1,614,121. This is a first approach to estimate the cost of the use of diving in fisheries for the health services but for the fishing communities as well. Furthermore, this is an important first step on the road to a full economic evaluation of the benthic fisheries in order to improve their management.","

"Aquaculture has been the fastest growing animal production industry for the past four decades, and almost half of the fish eaten in the world are now farmed fish. To prevent diseases in this more intensive aquaculture farming, use of therapeutic chemicals has become a basic choice. The monitoring of malachite green, a triphenylmethane dye and one of the oldest and widely used chemicals in fish production, has gained more interest since the mid 1990s when this substance was finally proven to be toxic enough to be prohibited in seafood products destined for human consumption. The enforcement of the European Union (EU) regulation of this banned substance along with some other triphenylmethane dye congeners and their metabolites in its domestic production and in seafood imports was undertaken through the National Residue Monitoring Plans implemented in nearly all of the 28 EU member states. The reliability of the overall European monitoring of this dye contamination in aquaculture products was assessed by using the results of proficiency testing (PT) studies provided by the EU Reference Laboratory (EU-RL) in charge of the network of the EU National Reference Laboratories (NRLs). The proficiency of each NRL providing analytical support services for regulating dye residues was carefully checked during three PT rounds. In the process, the analytical methods developed and validated for this purpose have gradually been improved and extended over the last two decades.",,"

      A household survey was conducted in 40 localities (n = 520) of Mâncio Lima and Rodrigues Alves municipalities, Acre state. Information on previous malaria, schooling, age, gender, income, occupation, household structure, habits and behaviors related to malaria exposure was collected. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was applied to characterize similarities between households and identify gradients. The association of these gradients with malaria was assessed using regression.

      The first three dimensions of MCA accounted for almost 50% of the variability between households. The first dimension defined an urban/rurality gradient, where urbanization was associated with the presence of roads, basic services as garbage collection, water treatment, power grid energy, and less contact with the forest. There is a significant association between this axis and the probability of malaria at the household level, OR = 1.92 (1.23-3.02). The second dimension described a gradient from rural settlements in agricultural areas to those in forested areas. Access via dirt road or river, access to electricity power-grid services and aquaculture were important variables. Malaria was at lower risk at the forested area, OR = 0.55 (1.23-1.12). The third axis detected intraurban differences and did not correlate with malaria.

      Living conditions in the study area are strongly geographically structured. Although malaria is found throughout all the landscapes, household traits can explain part of the variation found in the odds of having malaria. It is expected these results stimulate further discussions on modelling approaches targeting a more systemic and multi-level view of malaria dynamics.","

"Domoic acid (DA)-producing harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been present at unprecedented geographic extent and duration in recent years causing an increase in contamination of seafood by this common environmental neurotoxin. The toxin is responsible for the neurotoxic illness, amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), that is characterized by gastro-intestinal distress, seizures, memory loss, and death. Established seafood safety regulatory limits of 20 μg DA/g shellfish have been relatively successful at protecting human seafood consumers from short-term high-level exposures and episodes of acute ASP. Significant concerns, however, remain regarding the potential impact of repetitive low-level or chronic DA exposure for which there are no protections. Here, we report the novel discovery of a DA-specific antibody in the serum of chronically-exposed tribal shellfish harvesters from a region where DA is commonly detected at low levels in razor clams year-round. The toxin was also detected in tribal shellfish consumers' urine samples confirming systemic DA exposure via consumption of legally-harvested razor clams. The presence of a DA-specific antibody in the serum of human shellfish consumers confirms long-term chronic DA exposure and may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker in a clinical setting. Adverse effects of chronic low-level DA exposure have been previously documented in laboratory animal studies and tribal razor clam consumers, underscoring the potential clinical impact of such a diagnostic biomarker for protecting human health. The discovery of this type of antibody response to chronic DA exposure has broader implications for other environmental neurotoxins of concern.","

All seven cases presented with cutaneous lesions located on the finger, hand and/or elbow regions typical of M. marinum infection. Specimens were collected by skin biopsy for two of the seven cases; both cases tested positive for M. marinum by molecular detection (hsp65 gene amplification and sequencing), and one was confirmed positive for M. marinum by culture. All seven cases reported handling raw shrimp from an aquaculture facility in the Health Unit's jurisdiction. M. marinum is not a reportable disease in Ontario, and there are no known previous reports of a cluster of M. marinum reported in Ontario, Canada. A cluster investigation working group was struck that included representation from various agencies including Public Health Ontario (PHO), Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL), Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) and the two health units involved in case investigations. Several public health and aquaculture farming recommendations were made to mitigate further risks associated with handling of raw shrimp from the facility. Several challenges were faced during the investigation process. The paper discusses these challenges and public health recommendations made in order to mitigate occupational and public health risks related to the hazard identified.","

"Authorship is a central element of scientific research carrying a variety of rewards and responsibilities, and while various guidelines exist, actual author contributions are often ambiguous. Inconsistent or limited contributions threaten to devalue authorship as intellectual currency and diminish authors' responsibility for published content. Researchers have assessed author contributions in the medical literature and other research fields, but similar data for the field of ecological research are lacking. Authorship practices in ecological research are broadly representative of a variety of fields due to the cross-disciplinary nature of collaborations in ecological studies. To better understand author contributions to current research, we distributed a survey regarding co-author contributions to a random selection of 996 lead authors of manuscripts published in ecological journals in 2010. We obtained useable responses from 45% of surveyed authors. Reported lead author contributions in ecological research studies consistently included conception of the project idea, data collection, analysis, and writing. Middle and last author contributions instead showed a high level of individual variability. Lead authorship in ecology is well defined while secondary authorship is more ambiguous. Nearly half (48%) of all studies included in our survey had some level of non-compliance with Ecological Society of America (ESA) authorship guidelines and the majority of studies (78%) contained at least one co-author that did not meet International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) requirements. Incidence of non-compliance varied with lead author occupation and author position. The probability of a study including an author that was non-compliant with ESA guidelines was lowest for professor-led studies and highest for graduate student and post doctoral researcher-led studies. Among studies with > two co-authors, all lead authors met ESA guidelines and only 2% failed to meet ICMJE requirements. Middle (24% ESA, 63% ICMJE) and last (37% ESA, 60% ICMJE) authors had higher rates of non-compliance. The probability of a study containing a co-author that did not meet ESA or ICMJE requirements increased significantly with the number of co-authors per study although even studies with only two co-authors had a high probability of non-compliance of approximately 60% (ICMJE) and 15 to 40% (ESA). Given the variable and often limited contributions of authors in our survey and past studies of other research disciplines, institutions, journals, and scientific societies need to implement new approaches to instill meaning in authorship status. A byline approach may not alter author contributions but would better define individual contributions and reduce existing ambiguity regarding the meaning of authorship in modern ecological research.",,"

      The use of sentinel species for population and ecosystem health assessments has been advocated as part of a One Health perspective. The Arctic is experiencing rapid change, including climate and environmental shifts, as well as increased resource development, which will alter exposure of biota to environmental agents of disease. Arctic canid species have wide geographic ranges and feeding ecologies and are often exposed to high concentrations of both terrestrial and marine-based contaminants. The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) has been used in biomedical research for a number of years and has been advocated as a sentinel for human health due to its proximity to humans and, in some instances, similar diet. Exploiting the potential of molecular tools for describing the toxicogenomics of Arctic canids is critical for their development as biomedical models as well as environmental sentinels. Here, we present three approaches analyzing toxicogenomics of Arctic contaminants in both domestic and free-ranging canids (Arctic fox, Vulpes lagopus). We describe a number of confounding variables that must be addressed when conducting toxicogenomics studies in canid and other mammalian models. The ability for canids to act as models for Arctic molecular toxicology research is unique and significant for advancing our understanding and expanding the tool box for assessing the changing landscape of environmental agents of disease in the Arctic.

"Due to the health risk related to occupational air pollution exposure, we assessed concentrations and identified sources of particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a handcraft workshop producing fishing lures. The work processes in the site included polyurethane molding, spray painting, lacquering, and gluing. We measured total VOC (TVOC) concentrations and particle size distributions at three locations representing the various phases of the manufacturing and assembly process. The mean working-hour TVOC concentrations in three locations studied were 41, 37, and 24 ppm according to photo-ionization detector measurements. The mean working-hour particle number concentration varied between locations from 3000 to 36,000 cm-3. Analysis of temporal and spatial variations of TVOC concentrations revealed that there were at least four substantial VOC sources: spray gluing, mold-release agent spraying, continuous evaporation from various lacquer and paint containers, and either spray painting or lacquering (probably both). The mold-release agent spray was indirectly also a major source of ultrafine particles. The workers' exposure can be reduced by improving the local exhaust ventilation at the known sources and by increasing the ventilation rate in the area with the continuous source.",,"

"In Uganda, elevated HIV prevalence in fishing communities along Lake Victoria have been attributed in part to heavy alcohol use, but qualitative research is needed to understand the contextual factors influencing alcohol and sexual risk. Eight focus group discussions were conducted (n = 50; 23 male, 27 female) in Gerenge, Uganda with five occupational groups: fishermen, fishmongers, alcohol-sellers, commercial sex workers, and restaurant owners. Data was analyzed using content analysis. Alcohol use was prevalent and said to influence risky sex. Sex-related alcohol expectancies and occupational factors influenced individuals to drink during sex and structural factors related to the built environment, economy, and policy were identified as key contributors to both alcohol use and sexual risk in general. The findings highlight alcohol reduction as an important component of HIV/AIDS prevention and suggest structural interventions should be prioritized in this context.","

"Introduction:
        
      
      in February 2015, an outbreak of acute watery diarrhea was reported in two sub counties in western Kenya. Vibrio cholerae 01 serotype Ogawa was isolated from 26 cases and from water samples collected from a river mainly used by residents of the two sub-counties for domestic purposes. We carried out an investigation to determine factors associated with the outbreak.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Methods:
        
      
      we conducted a frequency matched case control study in the community. We defined cases as episodes of watery diarrhea (at least three motions in 24 hours) in persons ≥ 2 years who were residents of Rongo or Ndhiwa sub-counties from January 23-February 25, 2015. Cases were systematically recruited from a cholera line list and matched to two controls (persons without diarrhea since January 23, 2015) by age category and residence. A structured questionnaire was administered to evaluate exposures in cases and controls and multivariable logistic regression done to determine independent factors associated with the outbreak.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      we recruited 52 cases and 104 controls. Females constituted 61% (95/156) of all participants. Overall latrine coverage was 58% (90/156). Latrine coverage was 44% (23/52) for cases and 64% (67/104) for controls. Having no latrine at home (aOR = 10.9; 95% CI: 3.02-39.21), practicing communal hand washing in a basin (aOR = 6.5; 95% CI: 2.30-18.11) and vending of food as an occupation (aOR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.06-10.74) were independently associated with the outbreak.

"We previously reported the bioaccumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and perfluorinated compounds, in field-collected juvenile Chinook salmon from urban estuaries of Puget Sound, WA (Meador et al., 2016). Although the toxicological impacts of CECs on salmon are poorly understood, several of the detected contaminants disrupt mitochondrial function in other species. Here, we sought to determine whether environmental exposures to CECs are associated with hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in juvenile Chinook. Fish were exposed in the laboratory to a dietary mixture of 16 analytes representative of the predominant CECs detected in our field study. Liver mitochondrial content was reduced in fish exposed to CECs, which occurred concomitantly with a 24-32% reduction in expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Y coactivator-1a (pgc-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The laboratory exposures also caused a 40-70% elevation of state 4 respiration per unit mitochondria, which drove a 29-38% reduction of efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation relative to controls. The mixture-induced elevation of respiration was associated with increased oxidative injury as evidenced by increased mitochondrial protein carbonyls, elevated expression of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (gpx4), a mitochondrial-associated GSH peroxidase that protects against lipid peroxidation, and reduction of mitochondrial GSH. Juvenile Chinook sampled in a WWTP effluent-impacted estuary with demonstrated releases of CECs showed similar trends toward reduced liver mitochondrial content and elevated respiratory activity per mitochondria (including state 3 and uncoupled respiration). However, respiratory control ratios were greater in fish from the contaminated site relative to fish from a minimally-polluted reference site, which may have been due to differences in the timing of exposure to CECs under laboratory and field conditions. Our results indicate that exposure to CECs can affect both mitochondrial quality and content, and support the analysis of mitochondrial function as an indicator of the sublethal effects of CECs in wild fish.","

"The present study examined the concentrations of mercury (Hg), methylmercury (MeHg), and selenium (Se) in the multiple tissues of the Plotosus canius and Periophthalmodon schlosseri collected from the Strait of Malacca. The mean value in mg kg(-1) of Hg (P. canius: 0.34 ± 0.19; P. schlosseri: 0.32 ± 0.18) and MeHg in muscle (P. canius: 0.14 ± 0.11; P. schlosseri: 0.17 ± 0.11) were below the Codex general standard for contaminants and toxins in food and feed (CODEX STAN 193-1995), the Malaysian Food Regulation 1985 and the Japan Food Sanitation Law. For P. canius, the liver contained the highest concentrations of Hg (0.48 ± 0.07 mg kg(-1)) and MeHg (0.21 ± 0.00 mg kg(-1)), whereas for P. schlosseri, the gill contained the highest concentrations of Hg (0.36 ± 0.06 mg kg(-1)) and MeHg (0.21 ± 0.05 mg kg(-1)). The highest concentration of (80)Se (mg kg(-1)) was observed in the liver of P. canius (20.34 ± 5.68) and in the gastrointestinal tract (3.18 ± 0.42) of P. schlosseri. The selenium:mercury (Se:Hg) molar ratios were above 1 and the positive selenium health benefit value (HBVSe) suggesting the possible protective effects of Se against Hg toxicity. The estimate weekly intakes (EWIs) in μg kg(-1) body weight (bw) week(-1) of Hg (P. canius: 0.27; P. schlosseri: 0.15) and MeHg (P. canius: 0.11; P. schlosseri: 0.08) were found to be lower than the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).

"Occupation- and industry-based risks for stroke and ischemic heart disease may vary among Japanese working-aged men. We examined the differences in mortality rates between stroke and ischemic heart disease by occupation and industry among employed Japanese men aged 25-59 years. In 2010, we obtained occupation- and industry-specific vital statistics data from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare dataset. We analyzed data for Japanese men who were aged 25-59 years in 2010, grouped in 5-year age intervals. We estimated the mortality rates of stroke and ischemic heart disease in each age group for occupation and industry categories as defined in the national census. We did not have detailed individual-level variables. We used the number of employees in 2010 as the denominator and the number of events as the numerator, assuming a Poisson distribution. We conducted separate regression models to estimate the incident relative risk for stroke and ischemic heart disease for each category compared with the reference categories ""sales"" (occupation) and ""wholesale and retail"" (industry). When compared with the reference groups, we found that occupations and industries with a relatively higher risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease were: service, administrative and managerial, agriculture and fisheries, construction and mining, electricity and gas, transport, and professional and engineering. This suggests there are occupation- and industry-based mortality risk differences of stroke and ischemic heart disease for Japanese working-aged men. These differences in risk might be explained to factors associated with specific occupations or industries, such as lifestyles or work styles, which should be explored in further research. The mortality risk differences of stroke and ischemic heart disease shown in the present study may reflect an excessive risk of Karoshi (death from overwork).","

"The use of pesticides for crop production has grown rapidly in Thailand during the last decade, resulting in significantly greater potential for exposure among children living on farms. Although some previous studies assessed exposures to pesticides in this population, no studies have been conducted to evaluate corresponding health effects. Twenty-four children from a rice farming community (exposed) and 29 from an aquaculture (shrimp) community (control) completed the study. Participants completed a neurobehavioral test battery three times at 6 month intervals: Session I: preliminary orientation; Session II: high pesticide use season; Session III: low pesticide-use season. Only sessions II and III were used in the analyses. High and low pesticide use seasons were determined by pesticide use on rice farms. Urinary metabolites of organophosphates (OPs) and pyrethroids (PYR) were analyzed from first morning void samples collected the day of neurobehavioral testing. Rice farm participants had significantly higher concentrations of dialkylphosphates (DAPs) (common metabolites of OPs) and TCPy (a specific metabolite of chlorpyrifos) than aquaculture farm children during both seasons. But, TCPy was significantly higher during the low rather than the high pesticide use season for both participant groups. Rice farm children had significantly higher DCCA, a metabolite of PYR, than aquaculture participants only during the high exposure season. Otherwise, no significant differences in PYR metabolites were noted between the participant groups or seasons. No significant adverse neurobehavioral effects were observed between participant groups during either the high or low pesticide use season. After controlling for differences in age and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scores, DAPs, TCPy, and PYR were not significant predictors of adverse neurobehavioral performance during either season. Increasing DAP and PYR metabolites predicted some relatively small improvement in latency of response. However, due to the small sample size and inability to characterize chronic exposure, any significant differences observed should be regarded with caution. Moreover although not statistically significant, confidence intervals suggest that small to moderate adverse effects of pesticide exposure cannot be ruled out for some indicators of neurobehavioral performance.","

"Proteases are probably underestimated exposure agents in bioaerosols. Their roles as barrier disrupters in allergic sensitization and activators of innate inflammation call for more attention in exposure-response studies. The main objectives of this study was (i) to establish a suitable method for detection of small quantities of proteases in filtered air samples and (ii) to utilize the method to characterize exposure to proteases in a salmon industry work environment. Analysis of proteases in filtered air samples was based on zymography, using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 0.1% gelatin as substrate added in the polyacrylamide gel. Gelatinase activity was evident as cleared (unstained) regions. The area of these regions was quantified using image analysis (UVP Vision Works®). Standard curves with known amounts of active porcine trypsin were added to each gel. Validation of 11 non-linear standard curves showed R2 (range) = 0.8989-0.9882, limit of detection = 0.056 nM, lower limit of quantification = 0.161 nM, and coefficients of variations (range) = 20-28%. Sampling of bioaerosols in salmon industry was performed using polytetrafluoretylene filters with an airflow of 3 l min-1. All samples contained visible bands close to the size of porcine trypsin (23.3 kDa). The bands did not disappear in the presence of EDTA but abolished by Pefabloc, demonstrating that the enzyme is a serine protease, most likely salmon trypsin. Airborne levels of active protease were below the statistical detection limit in the filleting department but quantifiable in extract samples from the slaughter department. Three filtered air samples from the slaughter department showed air concentrations of 6.2, 16.5, and 27.0 ng m-3 air. We conclude that zymography is a sensitive and reliable method for exposure assessment of active proteases in indoor environmental samples. We recommend this assay for use in occupational studies to characterize and quantify exposure to active proteases in bioaerosols.",,"

"Agricultural operations are important sources of organic dust containing particulate matter (PM) and endotoxins, which have possible negative health consequences for both humans and animals. Dust concentrations and composition in calf barns, as well as the potential health effects for these animals, are scarcely documented. The objective of this study was to measure PM fractions and endotoxin concentrations in calf barns and study their associations with lung consolidation, respiratory tract inflammation, and infection in group-housed calves. In this cross-sectional study, samples from 24 dairy farms and 23 beef farms were collected in Belgium from January to April 2017. PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 (defined as particulate matter passing through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at a 1.0-μm, 2.5-μm, and 10-μm aerodynamic diameter, respectively) were sampled during a 24-h period using a Grimm aerosol spectrometer (Grimm Aerosol Technik Ainring GmbH & Co. KG). Endotoxin concentration was measured in the PM10 fraction. Thoracic ultrasonography was performed and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid was collected for cytology and bacteriology. Average PM concentrations were 16.3 µg/m3 (standard deviation, SD: 17.1; range: 0.20-771), 25.0 µg/m3 (SD: 25.3; range: 0.50-144.9), and 70.3 µg/m3 (SD: 54.5; range: 1.6-251.2) for PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. Mean endotoxin in the PM10 fraction was 4.2 endotoxin units (EU)/µg (SD: 5.50; range: 0.03-30.3). Concentrations in air were 205.7 EU/m3 (SD: 197.5; range: 2.32-901.0). Lung consolidations with a depth of ≥1, ≥3, and ≥6 cm were present in 43.1% (146/339), 27.4% (93/339), and 15.3% (52/339) of the calves, respectively. Exposure to fine (PM1.0) PM fractions was associated with increased odds of lung consolidations of ≥1 cm (odds ratio, OR: 3.3; confidence interval (CI): 1.5-7.1), ≥3 cm (OR: 2.8; CI: 1.2-7.1), and ≥6 cm (OR: 12.3; CI: 1.2-125.0). The odds of having lung consolidations of ≥1 cm (OR: 13.9; CI: 3.4-58.8) and ≥3 cm (OR: 6.7; 1.7-27.0) were higher when endotoxin concentrations in the dust mass exceeded 8.5 EU/µg. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid neutrophil percentage was positively associated with PM10 concentration, and epithelial cell percentage was negatively associated with this fraction. Concentration of PM2.5 was positively associated with epithelial cell percentage and isolation of Pasteurella multocida. Although concentrations of fine dust are lower in calf barns than in poultry and pig housings, in this study they were associated with pneumonia in calves. Dust control strategies for reducing fine dust fractions in calf barns may benefit human and animal respiratory health.","

"Quality of life is an indicator of how well one perceives that he/she is functioning physically and mentally. The aim of this paper is to determine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of artisanal fisherwomen/shellfish gatherers from the Saubara municipality in Bahia, Brazil in comparison to the general population. A structured questionnaire was administered to a sample of 209 artisanal fisherwomen selected at random. The HRQOL questionnaire, known as the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey version 1 (SF-36v01), was also used, having been translated and verified cross-culturally for the Brazilian population. Sociodemographic, lifestyle and comorbidity information was also collected. Chronic diseases and indicators of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) were self-reported. The study population consisted primarily of individuals between 30 and 45 years of age (78%), of self-classified races black or brown (96.2%), with no more than an elementary school education (77%) and married (64.6%). In all the SF-36v01 dimensions, the values in the sample were lower than in the general population of Brazil, which was used as the reference population. In the ""Physical Health"" domain (Physical Functioning; Physical Role Limitations; Bodily Pain; General Health Perception) a tendency toward a lower health-related quality of life was observed among those who were older, had a lower education level, and had a prevalence of MSDs, hypertension or arthritis. The interference of health conditions linked to the fisherwomen's work activities may contribute to lower HRQOL in all analyzed aspects, in comparison to the general population. In light of these findings, public health policies must consider these informal workers who contribute greatly to Brazil's economy and food system.","Keywords:

"Wildlife management seeks to minimise public controversy for successful application of wildlife control methods. Human dimensions research in wildlife seeks a better understanding of public preferences for effective human-wildlife conflict resolution. In face to face interviews, 630 adults in Greece were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert-like scale their acceptance of 3 management methods, i.e., do nothing, non-lethal control, and lethal control, in the context of 5 human-wildlife conflict scenarios: 1) corvids damage crops; 2) starlings damage crops; 3) starlings foul urban structures; 4) coypus damage crops; and 5) coypus transfer disease. Univariate GLMs determined occupation, hunting membership and their interaction as the stronger predictors of public acceptance, generating 4 stakeholder groups: the general public, farmers, hunters, and farmers-hunters. Differences in acceptance and consensus among stakeholder groups were assessed using the Potential for Conflict Index2 (PCI2). All 4 stakeholder groups agreed that doing nothing was unacceptable and non-lethal control acceptable in all 5 scenarios, with generally high consensus within and between groups. The lethal control method was more controversial and became increasingly more acceptable as the severity of scenarios was increased and between non-native and native species. Lethal control was unacceptable for the general public in all scenarios. Farmers accepted lethal methods in the corvids and starlings scenarios, were neutral in the coypus damage crops scenario, whereas they accepted lethal control when coypus transfer disease. Hunters' opinion was neutral in the corvids, starlings and coypus damage crops and starlings foul urban structures scenarios, but they accepted lethal methods in the coypus transfer disease scenario. Farmers-hunters considered lethal control acceptable in all 5 scenarios. Implications from this study could be used for designing a socio-ecological approach which incorporates wildlife management with public interests. The studied species have a wide distribution, therefore present findings might also prove useful elsewhere.","

"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants in consumer products including electronic devices. Important routes of human exposure are contaminated food and contact with dust. In this study, we measured twelve PBDEs in household/workplace dust and blood plasma samples provided by 113 volunteers living in the Puget Sound region, WA and working at electronic waste (E-waste) recycling sites (n = 29) or non-specific indoor (n = 57) or outdoor occupations (n = 27). The volunteers in the outdoor group were also selected because of a history of high seafood consumption habits. Results indicated the sum PBDE levels varied between <2.5 and up to 310 ng g-1 lipid. E-waste recyclers were predominantly men, generally consumed low amounts of seafood, and had PBDE blood levels (geometric mean, GM = 26.56 ng g-1 lipid) that were similar to indoor workers (GM = 27.17 ng g-1 lipid). The sum PBDE levels were highest in the outdoor group (GM = 50.63 ng g-1 lipid). Dust samples from E-waste sites were highly enriched with BDE-209 and BDE-153 relative to non-E-waste businesses and homes. The concentrations of these BDE congeners in dust at E-waste sites were ∼32-39 times higher than in dust from other sites. However, the detection rate of BDE-209 in plasma was low across all groups (13%) and no statistical comparisons were made. Our results suggest that E-waste recyclers in this study population did not have elevated PBDE levels in comparison to volunteers working in other types of occupations.","

This article seeks to investigate the adaptive capacity of the Ncunjane farming community in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal in response to drought spells of 2010 and 2014. This article draws on data collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods in 2011 and later in 2015 with the data analysed through the Statistical Package for Social Science to determine significant correlations between variables. Analysis of the vulnerability and adaptive capacity is performed using conceptual framework. This study found that both smallholder farmers who engaged in livestock and crop production have experienced high cattle mortalities and stagnant crop productivity, which in turn put pressure on already constrained disposable household income because of increased food costs and agricultural input costs, particularly supplementary animal feed. Cattle owners were more vulnerable to drought because of poor risk management and thus became highly dependent on government to provide drought relief. Application for government drought relief was found not to be effective in cases of large herds of cattle. Variability of rainfall and prolonged heat spells has a significant impact on the sustainability of smallholder mixed-farming systems, leaving agriculture as a highly questionable form of livelihood for rural farming communities such as Msinga. The article recommends strengthened institutional mechanisms so that stakeholders should play a more meaningful role within provincial and local agriculture in leveraging government support but places emphasis on the adoption of innovative strategies that can potentially yield significantly resilient smallholder mixed-farming systems in the wake of climate variability.",,"

"Current approaches to reconstruct subsistence and dietary trends in ancient hunter-gatherer societies include stable isotope analyses, but these have focused on human remains, cooking pottery, and food residues, which are relatively rare in the archaeological record. In contrast, short-term hearths are more ubiquitous worldwide, and these features can provide valuable evidence for ancient subsistence practices, particularly when faunal remains are not preserved. To test the suitability of hearths for this purpose, we conducted multiple chemical analyses: stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of total organic matter (expressed as δ(13)C and δ(15)N values) and compound-specific carbon isotope analyses of individual fatty acids (δ(13)C16:0 and δ(13)C18:0) from 17 well-preserved hearths present in three occupations dating between ∼13,200-11,500 calibrated years B.P. at the Upward Sun River (USR) site in central Alaska. We combined δ(15)N and δ(13)CFA data in a Bayesian mixing model (stable isotope analysis in R) with concentration dependency to each hearth. Our model values were tested against faunal indices, indicating a strong positive relationship between marine proportional contributions to each hearth and salmon abundance. Results of the models show substantial anadromous salmon use in multiple USR components, indicating recurrent use of the site for salmon processing during the terminal Pleistocene. Our results demonstrate that salmonid and freshwater resources were more important for late Pleistocene hunter-gatherers than previously thought and highlight the potential of chemical profiling of hearth organic residues for providing greater geographic and temporal insights into resource use by prepottery societies.","

      Since 2009, most fisherman divers have changed their practices by reducing bottom time or depth. Mortality was reduced and the incidence of severe neurological DCS decreased by 75%. Twenty four cases of DCS were treated by IWR. Ten cases of joint pain were treated with IWR using air, affording immediate relief in all cases. Out of 10 cases of neurological DCS, 4/4 recovered completely after IWR with oxygen whereas only 2/6 subjects recovered immediately after IWR with air. In addition, 3/4 further cases of DCS treated with IWR using oxygen immediately recovered.

"In the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, fishing is a core occupation and also a source of marine plastic pollution. To look at this relationship, we examined 216 gastrointestinal tracts of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) caught by commercial fishers at Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. We found three tracts contained plastic for a frequency of occurrence of 1.4%. While this result is consistent with other cod sampled in the province, this study found two gastrointestinal tracts contained intact bait bags, used in commercial pots, and the third tract contained a polypropylene thread, likely originating from fishing rope. Our findings demonstrate the frequency of plastic ingestion in this region is low, but fishing-gear related plastics represent a key source of marine plastics in the region that should be addressed.","

"Background:
        
      
      European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is one of the most important species for European aquaculture. Viral nervous necrosis (VNN), commonly caused by the redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), can result in high levels of morbidity and mortality, mainly during the larval and juvenile stages of cultured sea bass. In the absence of efficient therapeutic treatments, selective breeding for host resistance offers a promising strategy to control this disease. Our study aimed at investigating genetic resistance to VNN and genomic-based approaches to improve disease resistance by selective breeding. A population of 1538 sea bass juveniles from a factorial cross between 48 sires and 17 dams was challenged with RGNNV with mortalities and survivors being recorded and sampled for genotyping by the RAD sequencing approach.
    
  

  


              
                


  
    
      
        
          Results:
        
      
      We used genome-wide genotype data from 9195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for downstream analysis. Estimates of heritability of survival on the underlying scale for the pedigree and genomic relationship matrices were 0.27 (HPD interval 95%: 0.14-0.40) and 0.43 (0.29-0.57), respectively. Classical genome-wide association analysis detected genome-wide significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to VNN on chromosomes (unassigned scaffolds in the case of 'chromosome' 25) 3, 20 and 25 (P < 1e06). Weighted genomic best linear unbiased predictor provided additional support for the QTL on chromosome 3 and suggested that it explained 4% of the additive genetic variation. Genomic prediction approaches were tested to investigate the potential of using genome-wide SNP data to estimate breeding values for resistance to VNN and showed that genomic prediction resulted in a 13% increase in successful classification of resistant and susceptible animals compared to pedigree-based methods, with Bayes A and Bayes B giving the highest predictive ability.

Tests of genomic prediction suggested that incorporating genome-wide SNP data is likely to result in higher accuracy of estimated breeding values for resistance to VNN. RAD sequencing is an effective method for generating such genome-wide SNPs, and our findings highlight the potential of genomic selection to breed farmed European sea bass with improved resistance to VNN.",,"

"Globally, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been relatively unsuccessful in meeting biodiversity objectives. To be effective, they require some alteration of people's use and access to marine resources, which they will resist if they do not perceive associated benefits. Stakeholders' support is crucial to ecological success of MPAs, and their support is likely to depend on their capacity to adapt to and benefit from MPAs. We examined the influence of social adaptive capacity (SAC) on perceived benefits of MPAs in Siquijor, Philippines, in the Coral Triangle. This region has substantial biodiversity and a population of over 120 million people, many of them dependent on marine resources for food and income. The region has many MPAs, most of which are managed under decentralized governance systems. We collected survey data from 540 households in 19 villages with associated MPAs. We evaluated the influence of multiple SAC variables (e.g., occupational multiplicity and social capital) on perceived benefits with decision trees (CHAID) and qualitatively analyzed this relationship with respect to types and recipients of benefits. Our models revealed the key role of social capital, particularly trust in leadership, in influencing perceptions of benefits (χ2 = 14.762, p = 0.000). A path analysis revealed that perceptions of distributional equity were a key mechanism through which social capital affected perceived MPA benefits (root mean-square error of approximation = 0.050). Building social capital and equity within communities could lead to more effective management of MPAs and thus to expenditure of fewer resources relative to, for example, regulation enforcement.","

"Flying foxes have been considered to be involved in the transmission of serious infectious diseases to humans. Using questionnaires, we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an Indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area. We surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in West Java. Villages were classified into 3 groups: inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1-5 km or 5-10 km away from the reserve's outer border. Data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics (age, sex and occupation); histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans, dogs and other domestic animals; and knowledge about infectious diseases, mainly rabies, in flying foxes. We found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food, especially during the fruit season. In these residential areas, flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals, especially dogs. People who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment, such as leather gloves, goggles and caps. The residents living around the conservation area mostly had poor knowledge about flying foxes and disease transmission. This situation shows that the population in this region is at a quite high risk for contracting infectious diseases from flying foxes.","

"Silver carp regularly consume and digest particles of food as small as 5 μm. This ability drives their efficient consumption of phytoplankton and because they feed low on the food chain they have an important place in aquaculture worldwide. In North America, where they are considered invasive, silver carp deplete food resources for native species and in so doing occupy increased niche space. Here, we determine the ontogenetic stage and size at which silver carp are morphologically capable of primarily feeding on particles <10 μm. Ecological studies on this species have shown that there is an ontogenetic shift in diet as predominantly zooplanktivorous juveniles later switch to eating much smaller phytoplankton. The occupation of this new trophic niche presents both a metabolic and a mechanical challenge to these fish, since it is unclear how they can efficiently feed on such small particles. We hypothesize that the epibranchial organ (EBO) in silver carp is essential in aggregating these small particles of food, allowing the species to consume mass quantities of tiny particles, thus mitigating metabolic constraints. In this study, we investigate early ontogeny of the EBO in silver carp to determine when this structure achieves the requisite morphology to become functional. We find that at around 80 mm standard length (SL) the EBOs are consistently filled with food, demonstrating that this accumulating organ has become functional. This size corresponds with previous ecological data documenting important shifts in the type of food consumed. While the basic bauplan of the EBO is established very early in ontogeny (by 15 mm SL), multiple waves of histological maturation of muscle, cartilage, gill rakers and epithelium ultimately form the functional structure.","

"This study investigated the i) kinetics, and ii) proportion of photolysis of 30 relatively stable active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) during artificial UV irradiation for 28 d in ammonium acetate buffer, filtered and unfiltered river water. Buffer was included to control removal kinetics under stable pH conditions and without particulate matter. Dark controls were used to determine removal due to other processes than photolysis and calculate the proportion of photolysis of the total removal. The removal of each API in each matrix was determined using online solid phase extraction/liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE/LC-MS/MS). Most APIs transformed during the 28 d of UV irradiation and the dark controls showed that photolysis was the major removal process for the majority of the APIs studied. The half-lives ranged from 6 h (amitriptyline) in unfiltered river water to 884 h (37 d, carbamazepine) in buffer. In unfiltered river water, the proportion of APIs with short half-lives (<48 h) was much higher (29%) than in the other matrices (4%), probably due to additional organic carbon, which could have promoted indirect photolysis. Furthermore, two APIs, memantine and fluconazole, were stable in all three matrices, while alprazolam was stable in buffer and unfiltered river water and four additional APIs were stable in buffer. Considering the relatively long-term UV-exposure, this study enabled the investigation of environmentally relevant half-lives in natural waters. Many APIs showed high persistence, which is environmentally concerning and emphasizes the importance of further studies on their environmental fate and effects.","

"Artisanal fishermen in the Yucatán Peninsula utilize hookah dive systems (HDS). The air compressors in these HDS are not filtered, and the intake is near the engine exhaust. This proximity allows carbon monoxide (CO) from the exhaust to directly enter the HDS volume tank and contaminate the fishermen diver's air supply. Conservative safety standards permit a diver's air supply to contain 10 parts per million (ppm) of CO. This study quantified the levels of CO in the diver's air supply both before and after physical separation of the engine exhaust from the compressor intake. CO levels in seven volume tanks were analyzed before and after a 1-inch hose was attached to the compressor intake and elevated 5 feet above the engine exhaust. The tanks were drained and refilled before collecting each set of pre- and post-intervention gas samples. Four CO measurements were collected before and after the intervention from each volume tank. A C-Squared© CO Analyzer (± 1 ppm), calibrated with a Praxair 70 ppm CON2 gas (± 5%), was used to analyze the gas samples. A paired samples t-test shows a statistically significant difference in average CO values before and after the intervention (t = 6.8674, df: 27; p⟨0.0001). The physical separation of the engine exhaust from the compressor intake reduced the CO contamination of the diver air supply by 72%. This intervention could be applied to the hookah systems in the rest of the fishing cooperative to reduce the divers' risk of CO poisoning.","

"Many fishers diversify their income by participating in multiple fisheries, which has been shown to significantly reduce year-to-year variation in income. The ability of fishers to diversify has become increasingly constrained in the last few decades, and catch share programs could further reduce diversification as a result of consolidation. This could increase income variation and thus financial risk. However, catch shares can also offer fishers opportunities to enter or increase participation in catch share fisheries by purchasing or leasing quota. Thus, the net effect on diversification is uncertain. We tested whether diversification and variation in fishing revenues changed after implementation of catch shares for 6,782 vessels in 13 US fisheries that account for 20% of US landings revenue. For each of these fisheries, we tested whether diversification levels, trends, and variation in fishing revenues changed after implementation of catch shares, both for fishers that remained in the catch share fishery and for those that exited but remained active in other fisheries. We found that diversification for both groups was nearly always reduced. However, in most cases, we found no significant change in interannual variation of revenues, and, where changes were significant, variation decreased nearly as often as it increased.","

"Domoic acid (DA) is a neuroexcitotoxic amino acid that is naturally produced by some species of marine diatoms during harmful algal blooms (HABs). The toxin is transferred through the food web from plantivorous fish and shellfish to marine mammals resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Due to the timing and location of DA producing HABs, it is well documented that pregnant female California sea lions (CSL) are regularly exposed to DA through their diet thereby posing exposure risks to a neuroteratogen in developing fetuses. In the present study, fluids from 36 fetuses sampled from naturally exposed pregnant CSLs were examined for DA. Domoic acid was detected in 79% of amniotic fluid (n = 24), 67% of allantoic fluid (n = 9), 75% of urine (n = 4), 41% of meconium (n = 17) and 29% of stomach content (n = 21) samples opportunistically collected from CSL fetuses. The distribution of DA in fetal samples indicates an increased prenatal exposure risk due to recirculation of DA in fetal fluids and continuous exposure to the developing brain.","

"Although fishing is of great economic importance, it has been described as a very dangerous and strenuous occupation worldwide. The current study was designed to determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) and explore the coping strategies of fishermen in the Oyorokoto fishing settlement in Nigeria. Three hundred and eighty-four fishermen with an age range of 18 to 64 years and a mean age of 34.12 years (SD = 6.52) were recruited. LBP was identified in 262 (68.23%) of the participants. LBP was significantly associated with age, educational status, and body mass index (BMI; χ2 = 102.23, p < .001) but not with marital status (p = .211). Severe LBP was identified among participants who were in the age group 35 to 44 years (33.93%), married (79.46%), primary education (45.54%), and abnormal BMI (73.32%). Participants ≥55 years (6.25%), widowers (1.79%), tertiary education (3.57%), and normal BMI (27.68%) had the least LBP. LBP was least prevalent in those who had practiced fishing for a duration of ≥21 years (25.57%) as compared with other groups (χ2 = 10.49, p = .03). The number of fishing trips per week was not significantly associated with the severity of LBP. Significant difference was identified between those who used nonmotorized boats as compared with motorized types (χ2 = 12.75, p = .002). The coping strategy with the highest score was religion 7.23 (SD = 1.12). The coping strategy with the lowest score was substance abuse 3.01 (SD = 0.57).

"Helminths are associated with health- and welfare problems in organic laying hens. The present observational cross-sectional study therefore aimed to estimate the prevalence and worm burdens of intestinal helminths in organic flocks of laying hens in 8 European countries, and to identify management factors that might be associated with helminth infections, with emphasis on Ascaridia galli. Data on flock-level management factors (e.g. nutritional factors, litter quality, housing system, opening- and closing hours of popholes, pasture rotation and provision of occupational materials) were collected during a farm visit when the hens were on average 62 weeks old. Worm counts were performed for 892 hens from 55 flocks and the number of ascarid (presumably primarily A. galli) eggs per g faeces (EPG) for 881 hens from 54 flocks. The association between parasitological parameters (prevalence, worm burden and EPG) and the management factors were analysed by multivariate models. Results showed that A. galli was highly prevalent across Europe with an overall mean prevalence of 69.5% and mean worm burden of 10 worms per hen. The overall mean prevalence and worm burden for Heterakis spp. were 29.0% and 16 worms per hen, respectively, with a large variation between countries. On average, the hens excreted 576 ascarid EPG. The mean prevalence of Raillietina spp. was 13.6%. A positive correlation was found between mean A. galli worm burden and ascarid EPG. Of the analysed management factors, only pasture access time had a significant negative association with A. galli worm burden which was in contrast to the general belief that outdoor access may increase the risk of helminth infections in production animals. In conclusion, the complexity of on-farm transmission dynamics is thus a challenge when evaluating the relative importance of management factors in relation to helminth infections.","

"The Gulf of Gabes is one of the most productive fishery areas in the southern Mediterranean Sea. It is archetypal of an ecosystem in which the effects of fisheries are most pronounced. Demersal trawling is the main fishing activity in the Gulf of Gabes. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to assess the environmental performance landing 1t of seafood with wooden demersal trawlers in the Gulf of Gabes. Impact categories included in the study were abiotic depletion potential (ADP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), photochemical oxidant formation potential (POFP), human toxicity potential (HTP), marine eco-toxicity potential (METP), terrestrial eco-toxicity potential (TETP), land occupation potential (LOP), and total cumulative energy demand (TCED). Demersal trawlers were classified based on their impact intensity. Results showed that 70% of the vessels had relatively low impacts. Impact intensity was proportional to the amount of fuel consumed to land 1t of seafood. Ships that fished less had the highest impacts per ton, due to lower fishing effort and catch per unit effort. This is likely to typify vessels that target highly valuable species such as shrimp. Onboard vessel activities contributed most to different environmental impacts (AP, EP, GWP and POFP), related to the high energy use of this fishery. Several impacts (ADP, ODP, METP, LOP and TCED) were associated mainly with fuel and lubricating oil production. Therefore, improvements must focus on minimizing fuel consumption. LCA is a valuable tool for assessing how to increase environmental sustainability of demersal trawling and it can help stakeholders identify the main operational issues that require improvement.","

"This study was conducted in an artisanal fishing community. The main health complaints included musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) attributable to working conditions. The present work found a prevalence of neck and distal upper limb MSD among the artisan fisherwomen/shellfish gatherers in Saubara, Bahia, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional cohort epidemiological study involving 209 artisanal fisherwomen/shellfish gatherers. The Brazilian version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and a survey listing physical demands adapted to shellfish gathering were used for the study. The MSD values obtained in some part of the body, neck or shoulder, and distal upper limb were 94.7%, 71.3% and 70.3%, respectively. The shellfish gatherers were found to work long shifts despite the high prevalence of MSD. The factors that cause these women to keep performing such activities include the need to make a living and provide food for their families through the sale and consumption of seafood.",,"

      Decompression sickness is endemic to small-scale fishermen-divers from coastal communities in southeast Mexico; overweight and obesity are also highly prevalent in the region. Existing literature suggests it is possible that fat tissue could play a role in decompression sickness pathophysiology. Our aim in this study is to describe the association between the number and severity of DCS events treated at the hyperbaric program and fishermen-diver body mass index.

"Residues of anti-neoplastic drugs represent new and emerging pollutants in aquatic environments. Many of these drugs are genotoxic, and it has been postulated that they can cause adverse effects in aquatic ecosystems. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most extensively used anti-neoplastic drugs in cancer therapy, and this article describes the results of the first investigation using a two-generation toxicity study design with zebrafish (Danio rerio). Exposure of zebrafish to 5-FU (0.01, 1.0 and 100 μg/L) was initiated with adult zebrafish (F0 generation) and continued through the hatchings and adults of the F1 generation, and the hatchings of the F2 generation, to day 33 post-fertilisation. The exposure did not affect survival, growth and reproduction of the zebrafish; however, histopathological changes were observed in the liver and kidney, along with genotoxic effects, at all 5-FU concentrations. Increases in DNA damage determined using the comet assay were significant in the liver and blood cells, but not in the gills and gonads. In erythrocytes, a significant, dose-dependent increase in frequency of micronuclei was observed at all 5-FU concentrations. Whole genome transcriptomic analysis of liver samples of F1 generation zebrafish exposed to 0.01 μg/L and 1 μg/L 5-FU revealed dose-dependent increases in the number of differentially expressed genes, including up-regulation of several DNA-damage-responsive genes and oncogenes (i.e., jun, myca). Although this chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 5-FU did not affect the reproduction of the exposed zebrafish, it cannot be excluded that 5-FU can lead to degenerative changes, including cancers, which over long-term exposure of several generations might affect fish populations. The data from this study contribute to a better understanding of the potential consequences of chronic exposure of fish to low concentrations of anti-neoplastic drugs, and they demonstrate that further studies into multi-generation toxicity are needed.","Keywords:

"Large-scale coral reef restoration is needed to help recover structure and function of degraded coral reef ecosystems and mitigate continued coral declines. In situ coral propagation and reef restoration efforts have scaled up significantly in past decades, particularly for the threatened Caribbean staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, but little is known about the role that native competitors and predators, such as farming damselfishes, have on the success of restoration. Steep declines in A. cervicornis abundance may have concentrated the negative impacts of damselfish algal farming on a much lower number of coral prey/colonies, thus creating a significant threat to the persistence and recovery of depleted coral populations. This is the first study to document the prevalence of resident damselfishes and negative effects of algal lawns on A. cervicornis along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). Impacts of damselfish lawns on A. cervicornis colonies were more prevalent (21.6% of colonies) than those of other sources of mortality (i.e., disease (1.6%), algal/sponge overgrowth (5.6%), and corallivore predation (7.9%)), and damselfish activities caused the highest levels of tissue mortality (34.6%) among all coral stressors evaluated. The probability of damselfish occupation increased as coral colony size and complexity increased and coral growth rates were significantly lower in colonies with damselfish lawns (15.4 vs. 29.6 cm per year). Reduced growth and mortality of existing A. cervicornis populations may have a significant effect on population dynamics by potentially reducing important genetic diversity and the reproductive potential of depleted populations. On a positive note, however, the presence of resident damselfishes decreased predation by other corallivores, such as Coralliophila and Hermodice, and may offset some negative impacts caused by algal farming. While most negative impacts of damselfishes identified in this study affected large individual colonies and <50% of the A. cervicornis population along the FRT, the remaining wild staghorn population, along with the rapidly increasing restored populations, continue to fulfill important functional roles on coral reefs by providing essential habitat and refuge to other reef organisms. Although the effects of damselfish predation are, and will continue to be, pervasive, successful restoration efforts and strategic coral transplantation designs may help overcome damselfish damage by rapidly increasing A. cervicornis cover and abundance while also providing important information to educate future conservation and management decisions.",,"

"Elevated concentrations of CO2 in seawater can disrupt numerous sensory systems in marine fish. This is of particular concern for Pacific salmon because they rely on olfaction during all aspects of their life including during their homing migrations from the ocean back to their natal streams. We investigated the effects of elevated seawater CO2 on coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) olfactory-mediated behavior, neural signaling, and gene expression within the peripheral and central olfactory system. Ocean-phase coho salmon were exposed to three levels of CO2 , ranging from those currently found in ambient marine water to projected future levels. Juvenile coho salmon exposed to elevated CO2 levels for 2 weeks no longer avoided a skin extract odor that elicited avoidance responses in coho salmon maintained in ambient CO2 seawater. Exposure to these elevated CO2 levels did not alter odor signaling in the olfactory epithelium, but did induce significant changes in signaling within the olfactory bulb. RNA-Seq analysis of olfactory tissues revealed extensive disruption in expression of genes involved in neuronal signaling within the olfactory bulb of salmon exposed to elevated CO2 , with lesser impacts on gene expression in the olfactory rosettes. The disruption in olfactory bulb gene pathways included genes associated with GABA signaling and maintenance of ion balance within bulbar neurons. Our results indicate that ocean-phase coho salmon exposed to elevated CO2 can experience significant behavioral impairments likely driven by alteration in higher-order neural signal processing within the olfactory bulb. Our study demonstrates that anadromous fish such as salmon may share a sensitivity to rising CO2 levels with obligate marine species suggesting a more wide-scale ecological impact of ocean acidification.","

      During 2010-2014, 188 commercial fishing fatalities occurred in the United States. Vessel disasters and falls overboard remain leading contributors to commercial fishing deaths. The Atlantic scallop fleet stands out for achieving substantial declines in the risk of fatalities over the 15-year study period. However, fatality rates ranged from 21 to 147 deaths per 100 000 FTEs, many times higher than the rate for all US workers.

"The aim of the present study was to appraise the levels of heavy metal contamination (Zn and Pb) in sediment of the Langat River (Selangor, Malaysia). Samples were collected randomly from 15 sampling stations located along the Langat River. The parameters measured were pH, redox potential, salinity, electrical conductivity, loss of ignition, cation exchanges capacity (Na, Mg, Ca, K), and metal ions (Zn and Pb). The geo-accumulation index (I geo) and contamination factor (C f) were applied to determine and classify the magnitude of heavy metal pollution in this urban river sediment. Results revealed that the I geo of Pb indicated unpolluted to moderately polluted sediment at most of the sampling stations, whereas Zn was considered to be within background concentration. The I geo results were refined by the C f values, which showed Pb with very high C f at 12 stations. Zinc, on the other hand, had low to moderate C f values. These findings indicated that the sediment of the Langat River is severely polluted with Pb. The Zn concentration at most sampling points was well below most sediment quality guidelines. However, 40% of the sampling points were found to have a Pb concentration higher than the consensus-based probable effect concentration of 128 mg/kg (concentrations above this value are likely to cause harmful effects). This result not only highlights the severity of Pb pollution in the sediment of the Langat River, but also the potential risk it poses to the environment.","

However, information regarding influence of geographic, lifestyle and demographic factor on PFAS levels in human blood tissues is limited. In this study, whole blood samples collected in 2006-2007 from 319 donors from suburban Seoul (Suwon and Yongin), Busan and Yeosu in Korea were analyzed for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA). Blood donors classified into seven age groups with ages ranging from 8 to 82 years, and different lifestyles and socio-economic status. PFOS (median=4.15 ng/mL) was found at the highest concentration with a maximum concentration of 59.1 ng/mL. The concentrations of other PFASs were in the decreasing order of; PFOA (median=1.30 ng/mL)>PFNA (median=0.85 ng/mL)>PFHxS (median=0.47 ng/mL)>PFOSA (median=0.12 ng/mL). Geographical differences in the concentrations of five target PFASs were found. Significant positive relationships between PFAS concentrations and the age of the donors were found. Gender-related differences were found in the concentrations of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOSA. No association was found between PFAS levels and several lifestyle factors and socio-economic status which included drinking habit, furniture/carpet in an indoor environment and monthly income. Occupation was an important determinant for PFNA and PFHxS concentrations in the whole blood. Except for PFOSA, significant associations were noted between PFASs concentrations and smoking habit. The results of this study provide information for further public health monitoring and safety management for PFASs in Korea.","

"Probably as a function of their wide geographical distribution, the different population of Macrobrachium amazonicum shrimp may present distinct physiological, biochemical, reproductive, behavioral, and ecological patterns. These differences are so accentuated that the existence of allopatric speciation has been suggested, although initial studies indicate that the genetic variability of populations happen at an intraspecific level. Among the biological responses described for M. amazonicum populations, those regarding osmoregulation and metabolism play a key role for being related to the occupation of diverse habitats. To this effect, we investigated osmoregulation through the role of free amino acids in cell volume control and metabolism, through oxygen consumption in larvae (zoeae I, II, V and IX) and/or post-larvae of a M. amazonicum population from Amazon, kept in aquaculture fish hatcheries in the state of São Paulo. The results add information regarding the existence of distinct physiological responses among M. amazonicum populations and suggest that possible adjustments to metabolism and to the use of free amino acids as osmolytes of the regulation of the larvae and post-larvae cell volume depend on the appearance of structures responsible for hemolymph osmoregulation like, for example, the gills. In this respect, we verified that zoeae I do not alter their metabolism due to the exposition to fresh or brackish water, but they reduce intracellular concentration of free amino acids when exposed to fresh water, what may suggest the inexistence or inefficient performance of the structures responsible for volume regulation and hemolymph composition. On the other hand, in zoeae II and V exposed to fresh and brackish water, metabolism alterations were not followed by changes in free amino acids concentration. Thus it is possible, as the structures responsible for osmoregulation and ionic regulation become functional, that the role of free amino acids gets diminished and oxygen consumption elevated, probably due to greater energy expenditure with the active transportation of salts through epithelial membranes. Osmotic challenges also seem to alter throughout development, given that in zoeae II oxygen consumption is elevated on brackish water of 18, but in zoeae V it happens in fresh water. After M. amazonicum metamorphosis, free amino acids begin to play an important role as intracellular osmolytes, because we verified an increase of up to 40% in post-larvae exposed to brackish water of 18. The main free amino acids involved in cell volume regulation of ontogenetic stages evaluated were the non essential ones: glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine, and proline. Interestingly, larvae from estuarine population studied here survived until the zoeae V stage in fresh water, but in some populations far from the sea, zoeae die right after eclosion in fresh water or they do not reach zoeae III stage. In addition, given that in favorable conditions caridean shrimp larvae shorten their development, we may infer that the cultivation environment, in which larvae developed in the present work, was appropriate, because almost all zoeae VIII kept on brackish water underwent metamorphosis directly to post-larvae and did not go through zoeae IX stage.",,"

Among the biological responses described for M. amazonicum populations, those regarding osmoregulation and metabolism play a key role for being related to the occupation of diverse habitats. To this effect, we investigated osmoregulation through the role of free amino acids in cell volume control and metabolism, through oxygen consumption in larvae (zoeae I, II, V and IX) and/or post-larvae of a M. amazonicum population from Amazon, kept in aquaculture fish hatcheries in the state of São Paulo. The results add information regarding the existence of distinct physiological responses among M. amazonicum populations and suggest that possible adjustments to metabolism and to the use of free amino acids as osmolytes of the regulation of the larvae and post-larvae cell volume depend on the appearance of structures responsible for hemolymph osmoregulation like, for example, the gills. In this respect, we verified that zoeae I do not alter their metabolism due to the exposition to fresh or brackish water, but they reduce intracellular concentration of free amino acids when exposed to fresh water, what may suggest the inexistence or inefficient performance of the structures responsible for volume regulation and hemolymph composition. On the other hand, in zoeae II and V exposed to fresh and brackish water, metabolism alterations were not followed by changes in free amino acids concentration. Thus it is possible, as the structures responsible for osmoregulation and ionic regulation become functional, that the role of free amino acids gets diminished and oxygen consumption elevated, probably due to greater energy expenditure with the active transportation of salts through epithelial membranes. Osmotic challenges also seem to alter throughout development, given that in zoeae II oxygen consumption is elevated on brackish water of 18, but in zoeae V it happens in fresh water. After M. amazonicum metamorphosis, free amino acids begin to play an important role as intracellular osmolytes, because we verified an increase of up to 40% in post-larvae exposed to brackish water of 18. The main free amino acids involved in cell volume regulation of ontogenetic stages evaluated were the non essential ones: glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine, and proline. Interestingly, larvae from estuarine population studied here survived until the zoeae V stage in fresh water, but in some populations far from the sea, zoeae die right after eclosion in fresh water or they do not reach zoeae III stage. In addition, given that in favorable conditions caridean shrimp larvae shorten their development, we may infer that the cultivation environment, in which larvae developed in the present work, was appropriate, because almost all zoeae VIII kept on brackish water underwent metamorphosis directly to post-larvae and did not go through zoeae IX stage.",,"

"Despite the high amount of pressure placed on benthic habitats by anthropogenic activities, particularly in coastal shelf areas, as yet, the impact of seabed damaging activities on ecosystem quality has not been included in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). We present a globally applicable impact characterisation approach, parameterized within 17 marine ecoregions in Europe. Our modelling approach includes two perspectives: the single-impact perspective and the repeated-impact perspective. The approach for the single-impact perspective is a function of the spatio-temporal scale and intensity of the anthropogenic disturbance, the initial benthic response, and an estimated ecological recovery period. The approach for the repeated-impact perspective additionally accounts for the industry-specific interval between disturbance events, allowing for consideration of potentially incomplete ecological recovery between disturbance events and therefore the potential for both recoverable and non-recoverable potential impacts. We exemplify the repeated-impact perspective for the benthic trawl fishing industry in Europe. Analogous to current approaches for characterizing land use impacts in LCA, we quantify characterisation factors (CFs) for both occupation and transformation impacts. CFs for occupation impacts are ecoregion-specific. CFs for transformation impacts are spatially differentiated at the resolution of seabed substrate type, categories of hydrodynamic energy, i.e. water movement due to the influence of waves and currents, fisheries management zone (repeated-impact perspective only) and marine ecoregion. We estimate ecological recovery times with consideration of the influence of seabed substrate type, hydrodynamic energy at the seabed and the stock of potential recolonizers. The characterisation factors allow for quantifying indicators of ecosystem damage from seabed disturbance in terms of a time-integrated relative species loss. With a single-impact perspective, the largest impact intensities are found in areas with the longest estimated ecological recovery time. In the repeated-impact perspective, the largest intensity of time-integrated non-recoverable impact occurs when the disturbance interval is equal to half the ecological recovery time.","

"In countries from which Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is absent, the causative virus, CCHF virus (CCHFV), is classified as a hazard group 4 agent and handled in containment level (CL)-4. In contrast, most endemic countries out of necessity have had to perform diagnostic tests under biosafety level (BSL)-2 or -3 conditions. In particular, Turkey and several of the Balkan countries have safely processed more than 100 000 samples over many years in BSL-2 laboratories. It is therefore advocated that biosafety requirements for CCHF diagnostic procedures should be revised, to allow the tests required to be performed under enhanced BSL-2 conditions with appropriate biosafety laboratory equipment and personal protective equipment used according to standardized protocols in the countries affected. Downgrading of CCHFV research work from CL-4, BSL-4 to CL-3, BSL-3 should also be considered.",,"

"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a commercially important high production chemical widely used in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, and is ubiquitous in the environment. Previous studies demonstrated that BPA activates estrogenic signaling pathways associated with adverse effects on reproduction in vertebrates and that exposure can induce epigenetic changes. We aimed to investigate the reproductive effects of BPA in a fish model and to document its mechanisms of toxicity. We exposed breeding groups of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L BPA for 15 d. We observed a significant increase in egg production, together with a reduced rate of fertilization in fish exposed to 1 mg/L BPA, associated with significant alterations in the transcription of genes involved in reproductive function and epigenetic processes in both liver and gonad tissue at concentrations representing hotspots of environmental contamination (0.1 mg/L) and above. Of note, we observed reduced expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) at environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA, along with a significant reduction in global DNA methylation, in testes and ovaries following exposure to 1 mg/L BPA. Our findings demonstrate that BPA disrupts reproductive processes in zebrafish, likely via estrogenic mechanisms, and that environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA are associated with altered transcription of key enzymes involved in DNA methylation maintenance. These findings provide evidence of the mechanisms of action of BPA in a model vertebrate and advocate for its reduction in the environment.","

      The pathogenesis of S. mansoni infection involves chronic inflammatory responses to parasite eggs which can be associated with a characteristic periportal fibrosis (PPF) and the progression to severe hepatosplenic disease. The effects of HIV-1 co-infection and the influence of CD4(+) cell numbers on these clinical manifestations of chronic S. mansoni are not known. To understand the effects of HIV-1 co-infection on these morbidities, we examined S. mansoni ultrasound-detectable morbidities in relation to HIV-1 infection and CD4(+) cell counts, and other factors in fishing communities where the two infections are present.

      Ultrasonographical examination was conducted during a cross-sectional study of 1,671 (aged 21-55 years) individuals in North-Western Tanzania. Blood samples were obtained for HIV-1 screening and CD4(+) cell quantification. A single stool sample was examined for S. mansoni eggs using the Kato-Katz technique.

Male gender (P< 0.001), age group 21-30 years (P< 0.028) and, residential time of 11-20 (P< 0.01) and ≥21 years (P< 0.01) were associated with PPF in S. mansoni infected individuals. The height-adjusted measurements of the left liver lobe were significantly larger in HIV-1/S. mansoni co-infected compared to S. mansoni only-infected individuals (t = -2.0702, P< 0.039). Predictors of the height-adjusted measurements of the left liver lobe and spleen were age, male gender, malaria infection, fishing occupation, village of residence and heavy intensity of S. mansoni infection. After accounting for these factors, neither HIV-1 infection nor CD4(+) cell counts predicted PPF, hepatosplenomegaly, measurements of the liver or spleen. Height-adjusted ultrasound measurements of the left liver lobe did not correlate with the CD4(+) cells counts in co-infected individuals (r = -0.16, P = 0.084).

"Poultry exposure is a major risk factor for human H7N9 zoonotic infections, for which the mode of transmission remains unclear. We studied the transmission of genetically related poultry and human H7N9 influenza viruses differing by four amino acids, including the host determinant PB2 residue 627. A/Silkie chicken/HK/1772/2014 (SCk1772) and A/HK/3263/14 (HK3263) replicated to comparable titers in chickens, with superior oropharyngeal over cloacal shedding; both viruses transmitted efficiently among chickens via direct contact but inefficiently via the airborne route. Interspecies transmission via the airborne route was observed for ferrets exposed to the SCk1772- or HK3263-infected chickens, while low numbers of copies of influenza viral genome were detected in the air, predominantly at particle sizes larger than 4 μm. In ferrets, the human isolate HK3263 replicated to higher titers and transmitted more efficiently via direct contact than SCk1772. We monitored ""intrahost"" and ""interhost"" adaptive changes at PB2 residue 627 during infection and transmission of the Sck1772 that carried E627 and HK3263 that carried V/K/E polymorphism at 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively. For SCk1772, positive selection for K627 over E627 was observed in ferrets during the chicken-to-ferret or ferret-to-ferret transmission. For HK3263 that contained V/K/E polymorphism, mixed V627 and E627 genotypes were transmitted among chickens while either V627 or K627 was transmitted to ferrets with a narrow transmission bottleneck. Overall, our results suggest direct contact as the main mode for H7N9 transmission and identify the PB2-V627 genotype with uncompromised fitness and transmissibility in both avian and mammalian species.

"Severe food poisoning events after the consumption of sharks have been reported since the 1940s; however, there has been no clear understanding of their cause. Herein, we report for the first time the presence of ciguatoxins (CTXs) in sharks. The identification by mass spectrometry of CTXs, including two new analogues, in a bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) that was consumed by humans, causing the poisoning and death of 11 people in Madagascar in 2013 is described. Typical neurotoxic ciguatera symptoms were recorded in patients, and toxicological assays on extracts of the shark demonstrated CTX-like activity. These results confirm this episode as a ciguatera poisoning event and expand the range of pelagic fish species that are involved in ciguatera in the Indian Ocean. Additionally, gambieric acid D, a molecule originally described in CTX-producing microalgae, was identified for the first time in fish. This finding can contribute to a better understanding of trophic relations within food webs. The present work confirms that consumption of sharks from the Indian Ocean should be considered a ciguatera risk, and actions should be taken to evaluate its magnitude and risk in order to manage shark fisheries.",,"

"The Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica) (GRD) is classified as one of the most endangered of all cetaceans in the world and the second scarcest freshwater cetacean. The population is estimated to be less than 2,000 individuals. In Nepal's Narayani, Sapta Koshi, and Karnali river systems, survival of GRD continues to be threatened by various anthropogenic activities, such as dam construction and interactions with artisanal fisheries. A basic description of the geographic scope, economics, and types of gear used in these fisheries would help managers understand the fishery-dolphin interaction conflict and assist with developing potential solutions. The main goal was to provide new information on the artisanal fishing communities in Nepal. The specific objectives were to identify, compile, and investigate the demographics, economics, fishing characteristics, and perception of fishermen about GRD conservation in the Narayani, Sapta Koshi, and Karnali rivers so conservation managers can develop and implement a potential solution to the GRD-fishery interaction problem in Nepal. Based on 169 interviews, 79% of Nepalese fishermen indicated fishing was their primary form of income. Fishermen reported fishing effort was greater in summer than winter; greatest in the afternoon (14:30 hrs ± 0:27) and during low water level conditions; and gear was set 4.8 ± 0.2 days/week. Fishermen reported using eight different types of monofilament nets (gillnets and cast nets). Sixty percent used gillnets less than 10 m long, and nearly 30% preferred gillnets between 10 and 100 m long; a few used gillnets longer than 100 m. Most fishermen reported they believed education, awareness, and changing occupations were important for GRD conservation, but they indicated that alternative occupational options were currently limited in Nepal. Nepalese fishermen acknowledged that fisheries posed a risk to GRD, but they believed water pollution, and dam/irrigation developments were the greatest threats.","

The inflammatory response was measured based on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation of transcription in a luciferase reporter gene assay and interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We observed that mixtures of SLIGKV-NH2 or trypsins with LPS augmented the activation of NF-κB and secretion of IL-8. The effect on IL-8 secretion was synergistic when both trypsins and LPS were used in the lower concentration range. The results demonstrate that exposure to mixtures of agents that are relevant to seafood industry workplaces may lead to increased inflammatory signalling compared with exposure to the individual agents alone.

Male gender, old age, residence in suburban/rural regions, low household income, low educational level, an occupation in agriculture or fisheries, and heavy smoking were significantly associated with COPD. Low intake of nutrients, including potassium, vitamin A, carotene, retinol, and vitamin C, was significantly associated with COPD. The prevalence of COPD in heavy smokers with the lowest quartile (Q1, <48.50 mg; 63.0%) and low-middle quartile (Q2, 48.50-84.38 mg; 56.4%) of vitamin C intake was significantly higher than that in subjects with the high-middle quartile (Q3, 84.38-141.63 mg; 29.5%) and highest quartile (Q4, >141.63 mg; 32.6%) of vitamin C intake (P=0.015). In multivariate analysis, male gender, old age, heavy smoking, and a low intake of vitamin C were significant independent risk factors for COPD. A significant reduction of 76.7% in COPD risk was observed with a Q3 vitamin C intake compared to Q1 vitamin C intake (odds ratio, 0.233; 95% confidence interval, 0.094-0.576) in heavy smokers.

      Lead loadings in all the floor dust samples from the Dandora, Kariobangi and Mukuru slums exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidance value for lead on floors with a range of 65.2 - 58,194 μg/ft2. Control floor dust samples recorded lower lead loadings compared to the Dandora, Kariobangi and Mukuru slums. Lead concentration in 70.7% of the soil samples collected from waste dumps, industrial sites, residential areas, playgrounds and preparatory schools in Dandora, Kariobangi and Mukuru exceeded the respective USEPA guidance values for lead in soils. Lead concentration in 100% of control soil samples were below the respective USEPA limits. The IEUBK model predicted that nearly 99.9% of children ≤ 7 years old living near informal ULAB recycling operations in Dandora, Kariobangi and Mukuru were at risk of being lead poisoned, with predicted blood lead levels (BLL) above the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reference value for blood lead.

"The secreted proteins of bacteria are usually accompanied by virulence factors, which can cause inflammation and damage host cells. Identifying the secretomes arising from the interactions of bacteria and host cells could therefore increase understanding of the mechanisms during initial pathogenesis. The present study used a host-pathogen coculture system of Helicobacter pylori and monocytes (THP-1 cells) to investigate the secreted proteins associated with initial H. pylori pathogenesis. The secreted proteins from the conditioned media from H. pylori, THP-1 cells, and the coculture were collected and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. Results indicated the presence of 15 overexpressed bands in the coculture. Thirty-one proteins were identified-11 were derived from THP-1 cells and 20 were derived from H. pylori. A potential adherence factor from H. pylori, elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu), was selected for investigation of its biological function. Results from confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analyses indicated the contribution of EF-Tu to the binding ability of H. pylori in THP-1. The data demonstrated that fluorescence of EF-Tu on THP-1 cells increased after the addition of the H. pylori-conditioned medium. This study reports a novel secretory adherence factor in H. pylori, EF-Tu, and further elucidates mechanisms of H. pylori adaptation for host-pathogen interaction during pathogenesis.","Keywords:

"Neuraminidase inhibitors are a cornerstone of influenza pandemic preparedness before vaccines can be mass-produced and thus a neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant pandemic is a serious threat to public health. Earlier work has demonstrated the potential for development and persistence of oseltamivir resistance in influenza A viruses exposed to environmentally relevant water concentrations of the drug when infecting mallards, the natural influenza reservoir that serves as the genetic base for human pandemics. As zanamivir is the major second-line neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, this study aimed to assess the potential for development and persistence of zanamivir resistance in an in vivo mallard model; especially important as zanamivir will probably be increasingly used. Our results indicate less potential for development and persistence of resistance due to zanamivir than oseltamivir in an environmental setting. This conclusion is based on: (1) the lower increase in zanamivir IC50 conferred by the mutations caused by zanamivir exposure (2-17-fold); (2) the higher zanamivir water concentration needed to induce resistance (at least 10 µg l-1); (3) the lack of zanamivir resistance persistence without drug pressure; and (4) the multiple resistance-related substitutions seen during zanamivir exposure (V116A, A138V, R152K, T157I and D199G) suggesting lack of one straight-forward evolutionary path to resistance. Our study also adds further evidence regarding the stability of the oseltamivir-induced substitution H275Y without drug pressure, and demonstrates the ability of a H275Y-carrying virus to acquire secondary mutations, further boosting oseltamivir resistance when exposed to zanamivir. Similar studies using influenza A viruses of the N2-phylogenetic group of neuraminidases are recommended.","

      An unusual case of tympanic membrane rupture in a diver due to impact from an Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar is described. The diver was treated conservatively and the injury fully healed by eight weeks after which the diver successfully returned to diving. The author contends that the appearances of such traumatic perforations differ from barotrauma in divers secondary to ear clearing problems on descent.

"The release of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into the environment has increased very substantially over the last decades. PAHs are hydrophobic molecules which can accumulate in high concentrations in sediments acting then as major secondary sources. Fish contamination can occur through contact or residence nearby sediments or though dietary exposure. In this study, we analyzed certain physiological traits in unexposed fish (F1) issued from parents (F0) exposed through diet to three PAH mixtures at similar and environmentally relevant concentrations but differing in their compositions. For each mixture, no morphological differences were observed between concentrations. An increase in locomotor activity was observed in larvae issued from fish exposed to the highest concentration of a pyrolytic (PY) mixture. On the contrary, a decrease in locomotor activity was observed in larvae issued from heavy oil mixture (HO). In the case of the third mixture, light oil (LO), a reduction of the diurnal activity was observed during the setup of larval activity. Behavioral disruptions persisted in F1-PY juveniles and in their offspring (F2). Endocrine disruption was analyzed using cyp19a1b:GFP transgenic line and revealed disruptions in PY and LO offspring. Since no PAH metabolites were dosed in larvae, these findings suggest possible underlying mechanisms such as altered parental signaling molecule and/or hormone transferred in the gametes, eventually leading to early imprinting. Taken together, these results indicate that physiological disruptions are observed in offspring of fish exposed to PAH mixtures through diet.","

"Populations of macro-algae and sessile invertebrates have precipitously declined in urbanised coastal waters in Australia since European occupation. Responses of healthy subtidal sessile assemblages to cumulative impacts and types of urban impacts were measured in one of the most polluted estuaries in Australia - the Derwent Estuary - by transplanting sessile communities established on pavers to locations adjacent to marinas, sewerage outfalls, fish farm cages, and stormwater discharges, each with associated controls. Reef communities translocated to sites adjacent to central urban pollution sources (within 5 km of Hobart) lost canopy-forming algae. Fish farms, marinas, and storm water drains were all characterised by higher filamentous algal cover than their controls. Marinas were associated with losses in canopy and foliose algae. Restoration of subtidal reef near highly urbanised areas is unlikely to be successful until current pollution levels are dramatically reduced.","

"Terrestrial land and its resources are finite, though, for economic and socio-cultural needs of humans, these natural resources are further exploited. It highlights the need to quantify the impact humans possibly have on the environment due to occupation and transformation of land. As a starting point of this paper (1(st) objective), the land use activities, which may be mainly socio-culturally or economically oriented, are identified in addition to the natural land-based processes and stocks and funds that can be altered due to land use. To quantify the possible impact anthropogenic land use can have on the natural environment, linked to a certain product or service, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool commonly used. During the last decades, many indicators are developed within the LCA framework in an attempt to evaluate certain environmental impacts of land use. A second objective of this study is to briefly review these indicators and to categorize them according to whether they assess a change in the asset of natural resources for production and consumption or a disturbance of certain ecosystem processes, i.e. ecosystem health. Based on these findings, two enhanced proxy indicators are proposed (3(rd) objective). Both indicators use net primary production (NPP) loss (potential NPP in the absence of humans minus remaining NPP after land use) as a relevant proxy to primarily assess the impact of land use on ecosystem health. As there are two approaches to account for the natural and productive value of the NPP remaining after land use, namely the Human Appropriation of NPP (HANPP) and hemeroby (or naturalness) concepts, two indicators are introduced and the advantages and limitations compared to state-of-the-art NPP-based land use indicators are discussed. Exergy-based spatially differentiated characterization factors (CFs) are calculated for several types of land use (e.g., pasture land, urban land).","

"This study examined population density, habitat and diet of Dasyatis marianae, a recently discovered species, in the reef complex of Maracajaú in Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. The highest concentration of D. marianae occurred in seagrass beds. Habitat use differed significantly between sex and age classes, with females and juveniles using areas other than reefs. Females utilized primarily seagrass beds and juveniles occurred mainly along the sandy bottom near the beach, highlighting the importance of protecting these areas. Dasyatis marianae diet was characterized primarily by crustaceans (91·9% index of relative importance, IRI ), including shrimp, crabs and lobsters. The availability of prey in different habitat types influences occupation by D. marianae, but the prey selectivity of D. marianae, among other factors, may affect this relationship. Intense shrimp and lobster fishing in the region probably has an effect on preferred prey resources of this ray. Information on feeding habits of this species contributes to a better understanding of trophic dynamics and food webs, which is critical if ecosystem principles are to be integrated into fisheries management.","

"Biologic sample collection in wild cetacean populations is challenging. Most information on toxicant levels is obtained from blubber biopsy samples; however, sample collection is invasive and strictly regulated under permit, thus limiting sample numbers. Methods are needed to monitor toxicant levels that increase temporal and repeat sampling of individuals for population health and recovery models. The objective of this study was to optimize measuring trace levels (parts per billion) of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), namely polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated-diphenyl-ethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), and hexachlorocyclobenzene, in killer whale scat (fecal) samples. Archival scat samples, initially collected, lyophilized, and extracted with 70 % ethanol for hormone analyses, were used to analyze POP concentrations. The residual pellet was extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Method detection limits ranged from 11 to 125 ng/g dry weight. The described method is suitable for p,p'-DDE, PCBs-138, 153, 180, and 187, and PBDEs-47 and 100; other POPs were below the limit of detection. We applied this method to 126 scat samples collected from Southern Resident killer whales. Scat samples from 22 adult whales also had known POP concentrations in blubber and demonstrated significant correlations (p < 0.01) between matrices across target analytes. Overall, the scat toxicant measures matched previously reported patterns from blubber samples of decreased levels in reproductive-age females and a decreased p,p'-DDE/∑PCB ratio in J-pod. Measuring toxicants in scat samples provides an unprecedented opportunity to noninvasively evaluate contaminant levels in wild cetacean populations; these data have the prospect to provide meaningful information for vital management decisions.",,"

"Mass drug administration has been less successful as a technique for controlling intestinal schistosomiasis (S. mansoni) than anticipated. In Uganda, the mass distribution of praziquantel has been provided to populations at risk of infection since the early 2000s, but prevalence mostly remains high. This is the case, for example, at locations in north-western and south-eastern Uganda. However, there is a remarkable exception. Among Madi fishing populations and their immediate neighbours, living close to the border with South Sudan, the rate of infection has dropped dramatically. A parasitological survey carried out at twelve fishing sites in 2013 identified only three cases of S. mansoni among 383 adults tested. This article asks: why is the prevalence of S. mansoni so low among fisherfolk in northern Uganda? Taking a biosocial approach, it suggests that the mass distribution of drugs, free of charge, has had an impact. However, the low prevalence of infection cannot be attributed to this alone. Other important factors may also have contributed to the decline in infection. These include changing fishing livelihoods, local attitudes to public health interventions, access to water and sanitation facilities, hygiene practices and the use of anti-malarial treatments. Above all, the article highlights the importance of investigating both social and biological dimensions of infection simultaneously, and of recognizing the local complexities of sustainably treating this debilitating parasitic disease.",,"

"Increased ingestion of aluminum (Al) can lead to its accumulation in the human body, especially in people with kidney problems. Al is also associated with several nervous diseases and its negative influence on embryo development during pregnancy has been proven in animal models. Hibiscus sabdariffa L. petals are widely used alone or in fruit tea formulas, which are recommended for drinking during pregnancy instead of tea. Its petals can contain similar and even higher amounts of Al as tea, which is a known Al accumulator. Our research investigated whether the regular intake of H. sabdariffa infusion leads to increased burden of Al. Sixteen days of ingestion of H. sabdariffa infusion (c Al = 0.5 mg.L-1) led to increased but unbalanced levels (15-86 μg L-1) of Al in urine compared to a period when the infusion was not ingested. The highest amounts of Al excreted were observed every third day during the ingestion. Mild health problems, such as nausea and dizziness (which could be related to plant properties) were reported by more sensitive volunteers.Our results suggest that the tea infusion from H. sabdariffa petals increases body burden of Al and, therefore, sensitive individuals as pregnant women and people with kidney problems should be cautious with excessive consumption of hibiscus infusion or fruit teas containing this plant. However, further study including more individuals is needed to fully confirm our preliminary results.","

      During a university class project related to climate change mitigation strategies, we utilized a university green space as a ""living laboratory"" for collaborative learning exercise to estimate landscape-level carbon biomass storage. The key objective of the exercise was to foster sustainability awareness with regard to the effectiveness of tree-planting initiatives to offset carbon emissions. Collaborative learning is a process by which students work together in small groups to accomplish a common goal. As experiences are active, social and student-owned, the process leads to the development of a variety of cognitive and transferable skills that are beneficial in academia and the workplace. Through data collection/analysis, the carbon biomass exercise not only allowed students to assess critically the efficacy of a tree-planting initiative as a means to sequester carbon, but they became aware of the difficulties in performing research on complex environmental issues. The intention of the research was to give students an opportunity to practice data collection, data analysis, problem solving, teamwork, communication and scientific literacy skills, meanwhile utilizing the campus open green space to enhance the knowledge discovery process. Informal assessment and discussions with students demonstrated that the activity was successful in reaching a wide range of students with varying backgrounds and initial attitudes about climate change mitigating strategies, which was our objective. Our case study demonstrates how learning objectives can be integrated with university sustainability initiatives to improve learning and student engagement. Finally, we see green spaces as dynamic settings for learning about physical processes and issues related to environmental management and sustainability.

"In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",Keywords: Autophagosome; LC3; cancer; flux; lysosome; macroautophagy; neurodegeneration; phagophore; stress; vacuole.,"Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)

"The tracer gas ratio method, using CO2 as natural tracer, has been suggested as a pragmatic option to measure emissions from naturally ventilated (NV) barns without the need to directly estimate the ventilation rate. The aim of this research was to assess the performance of a low-cost Non-Dispersive Infra-Red (NDIR) sensor for intensive spatial field monitoring of CO2 concentrations in a NV dairy cow house. This was achieved by comparing NDIR sensors with two commonly applied methods, a Photo-Acoustic Spectroscope (PAS) Gas Monitor and an Open-Path laser (OP-laser). First, calibrations for the NDIR sensors were obtained in the laboratory. Then, the NDIR sensors were placed in a dairy cow barn for comparison with the PAS and OP-laser methods. The main conclusions were: (a) in order to represent the overall barn CO2 concentration of the dairy cow barn, the number of NDIR sensors to be accounted for average concentration calculation was dependent on barn length and on barn area occupation; and (b) the NDIR CO2 sensors are suitable for multi-point monitoring of CO2 concentrations in NV livestock barns, being a feasible alternative for the PAS and the OP-laser methods to monitor single-point or averaged spatial CO2 concentrations in livestock barns.","Keywords:

      Understanding the mental constructs underlying people's social responses, decisions and behaviors is crucial to defining the governance challenges faced in dealing with marine anthropogenic litter. Using interactive governance theory, this study provides qualitative insights into how a small group of Arab-Israeli artisanal fishermen perceive marine litter and its impact (system to be governed) in the context of the socio-institutional structures (governing system) which manage waste and aim to protect the surrounding environment. It demonstrates that, until the relationships between local people and the various governing institutions are transformed, there is little hope for citizen cooperation in reducing marine litter long-term in the case-study site. More generally, underlying narratives and politics playing out at a local level need to be understood in order to identify which interventions are likely to be effective and which are not. An intervention checklist to assess the potential effectiveness of a marine litter intervention is proposed.

      The Generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) is widely used for modelling environmental data. However, such data are prone to influential observations, which can distort the estimated exposure-response curve particularly in regions of high exposure. Deletion diagnostics for iterative estimation schemes commonly derive the deleted estimates based on a single iteration of the full system holding certain pivotal quantities such as the information matrix to be constant. In this paper, we present an approximate formula for the deleted estimates and Cook's distance for the GLMM, which does not assume that the estimates of variance parameters are unaffected by deletion. The procedure allows the user to calculate standardised DFBETAs for mean as well as variance parameters. In certain cases such as when using the GLMM as a device for smoothing, such residuals for the variance parameters are interesting in their own right. In general, the procedure leads to deleted estimates of mean parameters, which are corrected for the effect of deletion on variance components as estimation of the two sets of parameters is interdependent. The probabilistic behaviour of these residuals is investigated and a simulation based procedure suggested for their standardisation. The method is used to identify influential individuals in an occupational cohort exposed to silica. The results show that failure to conduct post model fitting diagnostics for variance components can lead to erroneous conclusions about the fitted curve and unstable confidence intervals.

"We report a new species of aporocotylid trematode (Platyhelminthes: Digenea) from the heart of the orangelined cardinalfish, Taeniamia fucata (Cantor), from off Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef. We used an integrated approach, analysing host distribution, morphology, and genetic data from the internal transcribed spacer 2 of the ribosomal DNA, to circumscribe Phthinomita heinigerae n. sp. This is the first species of Phthinomita Nolan & Cribb, 2006 reported from the Apogonidae; existing species and known 'types' are recorded from species of the Labridae, Mullidae, and Siganidae. The new species is distinguished from its 11 congeners in having a body 2977-3539 long and 16.5-22.4 times longer than wide, an anterior testis 6.2-8.2 times longer than wide and 8.3-13.0 times longer than the posterior testis, a posterior testis whose width is 35-56% of the body width, and an ovary positioned 11-13% of the body length from the posterior end, and is entirely anterior to the posterior margin of the anterior testis. In addition, 2-34 base differences (0.4-7.0% sequence divergence over 485 base positions) were detected among the ITS2 sequence representing P. heinigerae n. sp. and the 14 representing other Phthinomita species/molecular types. Prevalence and intensity of infection with P. heinigerae n. sp. was relatively high within the heart tissue of T. fucata, with 19 of 20 fish examined from off Heron Island infected (95%) with 7-25 adult worms (arithmetic mean 16.6). Infections by these parasites accounted for an occupation of 7-30% of the total estimated heart volume.","Keywords:

"We report a new species of aporocotylid trematode (Platyhelminthes: Digenea) from the heart of the orangelined cardinalfish, Taeniamia fucata (Cantor), from off Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef. We used an integrated approach, analysing host distribution, morphology, and genetic data from the internal transcribed spacer 2 of the ribosomal DNA, to circumscribe Phthinomita heinigerae n. sp. This is the first species of Phthinomita Nolan & Cribb, 2006 reported from the Apogonidae; existing species and known 'types' are recorded from species of the Labridae, Mullidae, and Siganidae. The new species is distinguished from its 11 congeners in having a body 2977-3539 long and 16.5-22.4 times longer than wide, an anterior testis 6.2-8.2 times longer than wide and 8.3-13.0 times longer than the posterior testis, a posterior testis whose width is 35-56% of the body width, and an ovary positioned 11-13% of the body length from the posterior end, and is entirely anterior to the posterior margin of the anterior testis. In addition, 2-34 base differences (0.4-7.0% sequence divergence over 485 base positions) were detected among the ITS2 sequence representing P. heinigerae n. sp. and the 14 representing other Phthinomita species/molecular types.
