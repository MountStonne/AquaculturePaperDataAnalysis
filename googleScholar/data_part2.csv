Dissolved oxygen and aeration in ictalurid catfish aquaculture,"Feed‐based production of ictalurid catfish in ponds is the largest aquaculture sector in the USA. Feed has an oxygen demand, and increases carbon dioxide, ammonia nitrogen, and phosphate inputs to ponds. Major sources of oxygen in ponds are phytoplankton photosynthesis and mechanical aeration; the major sink for oxygen is respiration by fish and by microorganisms in the water column and sediment. Dissolved oxygen concentrations decline when respiration exceeds photosynthesis, and the most crucial time for low dissolved oxygen concentration is at night. Mechanical aeration is applied to avoid nighttime dissolved oxygen concentrations from falling below the critical level for catfish of 3 mg/L. Electrically powered paddlewheel aerators are used by most catfish producers. The oxygen‐transfer efficiency of these aerators is known, but calculations of aeration requirement from stocking and feeding rates are not reliable because of variation in phytoplankton abundance and in weather conditions. Dissolved oxygen concentrations must be monitored, and when measurements suggest that nighttime dissolved oxygen concentration will be unacceptably low, tractor‐powered emergency aerators must be operated to supplement dedicated aeration. Dissolved oxygen concentration also is important in hatcheries, and small aeration systems have been developed for hatchery application.",
"Economics of shrimp aquaculture and factors associated with shrimp aquaculture in Navsari district of Gujarat, India","In the view of recent set back of brackish water shrimp farming, the present study is aimed to highlight the profitability of shrimp aquaculture and factors associated with that in Navsari district of Gujarat. Maximum investments as well as productivity were observed in white legged shrimp compare to black tiger shrimp. The nuclear family was predominant on sample farm household in both the shrimp farming namely L. vannamei 65.38 percent and P. monodon 44.44 percent with an overall average of 54.91 percent. Maximum farm households 41.59 percent had family size of 4-6 persons followed by family size of 1 to 3 persons by 26.49 percent households. The average family size on the sample households was 5.49. The male were outnumbered in the sample households, and accounted for 40.94 percent of family size indicating the gap between male and female proportion. Educational status of head of sample farm households showed that in general, shrimp farmers had good education. On overall basis 97.18 percent farmers were literate and a sizable proportion 40.49 percent had education up to graduate level which was followed by education up to higher secondary level 17.91 percent. The revival phase of shrimp culture from the recent set back was observed by the study. Black tiger shrimp farmers and white legged shrimp earned a net profit of 5.57 Lakh/ha/crop and of 19.63 Lakh/ha/crop respectively. The black tiger shrimp was less profitable (1.95) than white legged shrimp (3.01). Some of the parameters estimated were significant at different levels, which were permanent labour, feed and experience in case of black tiger shrimp and feed and seed in case of white legged shrimp.",
O1D. 4 Occupational exposure to formaldehyde in france in 2015,"Context Formaldehyde has been used in a large range of activities for decades. It was classified as human carcinogenic in 2004 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and in France, formaldehyde has been regulated as a carcinogen since 2007.

The aim of this work is to describe the occupational exposure to formaldehyde in France in 2015 and to identify the most exposed activities.

Method A formaldehyde job-exposure matrix, developed under the MATGÉNÉ programme, provides an exhaustive and retrospective exposure assessment for all jobs in France. These data were linked with the 2015 French census, annually elaborated from 2013 to 2017, to estimate the occupational exposure prevalence by gender, occupation, industries and worker status.

Results In 2015, 90 000 workers were occupationally exposed to formaldehyde (3.5‰ of the French population at work), 60 600 (4.6‰) among men and 29 400 (2.4‰) among women.

The industries with the highest prevalence exposure rate were for men veterinary area (8.8%), wood industries (7.7%) and agriculture (4.8%); for women, veterinary area (7.3%), fishing and aquaculture (5.3%) and agriculture (5.1%).

The exposed workers are retrieved in agriculture (26%), healthcare sectors (13,5%) and specialized construction work (12%) for employees and agriculture (69.6%), specialized construction work (13.5%) and other personal services (8.1%) for people with worker status different (mostly self-employed).

Conclusion These results, the first describing the occupational exposure to formaldehyde in France, according to gender for the entire working population, show the importance of regulation in the variation of occupational exposure prevalence rates. This information will help in the surveillance of this occupational risk and to prioritize prevention actions.",
Technical efficiency of tank culture systems in peninsular Malaysia: an application of data envelopment analysis,"The demand for animal protein especially fish is growing rapidly perhaps due to rapid expansion of population, increased incomes, and changes in eating habits and life styles of consumers. Capture fisheries are currently overexploited and their yield has become stagnant over the last decades and, in some cases, has even declined. Nevertheless, aquaculture has the potential to meet these challenges if well practiced. The study therefore, aims to estimate Technical Efficiency of tank culture systems using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Additionally, it also investigates the determinants of technical inefficiency by employing a regression model. The estimated technical efficiency was 0.89, which means that the fish farmers can reach full technical efficiency through reducing their input usage by another 11%. Results indicate that farmer's experience, educational level, extension training, job status, and water management have positive and statistically significant impacts on technical efficiency. Therefore, increase in any of these factors will have a direct impact on technical efficiency.",
"Effects of climate change on aquaculture production and management in Akure Metropolis, Ondo State, Nigeri.","This study examined perception of fish farmers on the effect climate change, on aquaculture production and management in Ondo State, Nigeria. Both primary and secondary data were used. Multistage random sampling technique was used to select the communities and number of respondents in Akure metropolis. A total of 40 respondents/fish farmers were interviewed using well structured questionnaire and interview schedule. Climate variables data were collected from the Department of Agro climatology, Ondo State Ministry of Agriculture. Likert scale was used to determine the perception of the respondents on Climate Change. The effects of climate change on production were analysed descriptively. Record showed that, maximum temperature and amount of rainfall had been on increase over the years as a result of change in climatic pattern. However, all the respondents were aware of climate change due to changes in the climatic variables. Only 33% of the respondents were aware of adaptive strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change on fish farming. Fish production and food security is at risk in the study area if good management is not practice. Fish farmers should be encouraged through the extension agents to keep climate variable records for future references.",

Aquaculture review: South Africa.,"RISING from a slow start, aquaculture production in Africa is poised for sustained growth over the next two decades. The intersection of market opportunities, economic factors and environmental conditions positions the continent as arguably the “last great frontier” for aquaculture development – set to be a focal point of discussions at the World Aquaculture Society meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, in June 2017. South Africa has a limited suitable natural environment for aquaculture – but this has not hampered the country’s drive develop the aquaculture sector to supplement the productive marine fisheries that are its main source of seafood. While the country has well-developed infrastructure, supply chains and business institutions, a highly exposed coastline on the southern tip of Africa and water-scarce interior limit the environment for aquaculture production. Nonetheless, significant government support for sector development and investment, rising consumer demand for local and sustainable seafood, and a shift to a value-chain-driven growth strategy are key factors that have combined to create a competitive advantage and signal the “coming of age” of South African aquaculture.South Africans consume a relatively small 7.5kg/capita of fish products a year (against the global average of 17kg), but are beginning to consume more fish. While the market for red meat and poultry is considered saturated at around 40kg/capita, there is considerable scope for growth in fish consumption with aquaculture well positioned to exploit this market gap. The challenge to local producers is to produce fish at a price that is competitive with imports.World Aquaculture 2017 takes place in Africa for the first time, in Cape Town, South Africa, from 26-30 June 2017. The conference theme “Sustainable Aquaculture – New Frontiers for Economic Growth” turns the spotlight on Africa and the economic development and investment potential of aquaculture production in the world’s second-fastest growing regional economy. The conference programme will balance global, African and other regional perspectives, with the technical and scientific programme and diverse parallel sessions catering to the broad range of scientific, technical, business and policy interests in aquaculture. A successful feature of previous WAS meetings, AquaForum will provide an information-sharing and networking platform specifically for producers, while the conference will be complemented by a major international trade show. The meeting is set to launch an African Chapter of the World Aquaculture Society.",
Present status and occupational organization structures of freshwater fisheries cooperatives operated in the Marmara Region.,"In the fisheries sector, fisheries cooperatives have an effective role and contribution in each stage of fisheries production obtained by capture. Cooperatives are generally established by the economically poorer people for being successful against bigger economical power elites and making an economical contribution to the national economy. In this study, structures, point of views to the fisheries, production operations, problems and organizations of the fisheries cooperatives established for the aim of inland capture fisheries in the Marmara Region (provinces of Balıkesir, Bilecik, Bursa, Çanakkale, Edirne, Istanbul, Kırklareli, Kocaeli, Sakarya, Tekirdağ and Yalova) were investigated. Basic data used in this study were obtained from the related provincial directorates of the Turkish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock. Marmara Region takes the first place with a total of 163 cooperatives and a 29% share among the regional distribution of all fisheries cooperatives operated in Turkey. Survey forms prepared in the direction of the goal of the study were filled in by making phone calls with the cooperative directors or sent via mail to their addresses and hence raw data were collected. According to the results of this study, it was determined that there is a total of 36 inland capture fisheries cooperatives that were established and still operates in the provinces of the Marmara Region and 2177 fisherman are actively members of these cooperatives. In the provincial distribution of the cooperatives, Edirne takes the first place with a share of 33.3% and Sakarya and Tekirdağ takes the last place with 2,8% each. Because of unsuitable fishing areas, no inland capture fisheries cooperatives were detected in Istanbul, Kırklareli, Kocaeli and Yalova provinces. It was also observed that the previously established cooperative in Bilecik province has a tendency of shut down its operations in the recent time.",
An overview of diseases in fish hatcheries and nurseries.,"Quality and healthy fish seed is the prerequisite for sustainable aquaculture. A major challenge to the expansion of aquaculture production is the outbreak of diseases. Disease induced mortality is a serious issue for the fish seed industry. The immature immune system in fish makes the early developmental stages more susceptible to infectious diseases. Common fish diseases in hatcheries and in early rearing systems are caused by protozoan, ciliates, myxosporodians, worms, opportunistic bacteria and fungi. Production of healthy fish seed and their survival rate depends on the proper health management strategies, maintenance of good water quality, proper nutrition and application of biosecurity measures. The paper highlighted the different types of diseases, causative agents and their prevention and control measures in fish hatcheries and nurseries.",
"Risk factors for mortality during the first occurrence of Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome due to Ostreid herpesvirus? in Tasmania, 2016","Highlights
•The first occurrence of OsHV-1 associated mortality in TAS, Australia is described.
•High mortality was observed, oysters size was the most important associated factor.
•The association manually handling oysters and greater mortality is highlighted.
•Oyster ploidy and hatchery of origin were not associated with differential mortality.
Abstract
The microvariant genotype of Ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV-1 μVar) has caused repeated seasonal outbreaks of mass mortality in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) populations in Europe, New Zealand and in New South Wales, Australia. The first occurrence of OsHV-1 related mortality in Tasmania, Australia was in January 2016; mortality was documented and multivariable logistic regression analysis was undertaken to examine risk factors. Overall mortality was 78% but varied from 37%–92% across 6 farms and between 96% (0–20 mm length) and 33% (61–115 mm) across size classes. The odds of mortality were 3.2 to 3.8 times greater for baskets containing oysters with an average shell length ≤ 40 mm compared to those with an average > 61 mm. Generally, the greater the time on farm the lower the mortality, consistent with the increasing age and size of the oysters. The effect of stocking density on mortality changed with increasing time on farm (age). The standard density produced lower mortality than high or low stocking density particularly for spat. Mortality was nearly twice as likely when oysters were handled for routine husbandry in the 7 days prior to the outbreak compared to not handled. Ploidy and hatchery of origin did not alter the disease outcome. The variation in mortality with husbandry requires further investigation to determine if it can be exploited to help maintain productivity.

Statement of relevance
This descriptive epidemiological study documents the impact of the first occurrence of disease associated with Ostreid herpesvirus - 1 (OsHV-1) in Tasmania, Australia. OsHV-1 is an emerging and economically important pathogen. Describing the impact of OsHV-1 in new environments and identifying the association between farm management and mortality is important to develop effective disease control measures.",
A Review of Ghana’s Aquaculture Industry,"Globally, the aquaculture industry has seen significant development through increased fish production, as a result of increased demand for fish and fish products. Ghana's aquaculture sector has seen significant growth in recent years, due to the government/World Bank-funded fisheries program through Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MOFAD). The national aquaculture production grew from over 32,512 MT/y in 2013 to 52,470.49 MT/y, representing 11.3% of the national harvest, in 2016. Aquaculture production is projected to hit 72,000 Tons, representing 15% of national fish production, in the next 3-5 years. Despite the significant growth, the sector is faced with several challenges related to management and production problems. For instance, limited knowledge of modern aquaculture techniques, inadequate supplies of improved seed, lack of continuing aquaculture policy direction, and inadequate funding for research. Despite the challenges, there are some fantastic opportunities in Ghana's aquaculture industry such as the production of live fish food, marine fish and shellfish culture, integrated fish farming, the culture of indigenous fish species, and investment in the fish feed industry. In this review, we explore the current state, obstacles, potentials, and future opportunities for Ghana's aquaculture sector. We propose measures that should be looked at to overcome the challenges as well as improve production in the sector.",
Controlling emerging infectious diseases in salmon aquaculture ,"In this paper, the authors review the impacts of diseases facing salmon
aquaculture, drawing lessons from terrestrial animal diseases. They
discuss the implementation of current control strategies, taking into
account transmission patterns (vertical vs. horizontal), disease
reservoirs, and interactions with wild fish. In addition, the decisionmaking context of aquatic disease control and the institutional
organisation of control strategies are considered, with particular
emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of regulatory authorities and
the private sector. Case studies on the emergence and control of
infectious salmon anaemia worldwide and pancreas disease in Norway
are used to examine some of the controversies that may influence
decision making and provide lessons for the future.

"The social, economic, and environmental importance of inland fish and fisheries","Though reported capture fisheries are dominated by marine production, inland fish and fisheries make substantial contributions to meeting the challenges faced by individuals, society, and the environment in a changing global landscape. Inland capture fisheries and aquaculture contribute over 40% to the world’s reported finfish production from less than 0.01% of the total volume of water on earth. These fisheries provide food for billions and livelihoods for millions of people worldwide. Herein, using supporting evidence from the literature, we review 10 reasons why inland fish and fisheries are important to the individual (food security, economic security, empowerment), to society (cultural services, recreational services, human health and well-being, knowledge transfer and capacity building), and to the environment (ecosystem function and biodiversity, as aquatic “canaries”, the “green food” movement). However, the current limitations to valuing the services provided by inland fish and fisheries make comparison with other water resource users extremely difficult. This list can serve to demonstrate the importance of inland fish and fisheries, a necessary first step to better incorporating them into agriculture, land-use, and water resource planning, where they are currently often underappreciated or ignored.",
