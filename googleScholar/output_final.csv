"Abstract
Background

Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food-producing sectors. Little is known of the occupational exposures, risk factors and their associated adverse health outcomes among aquaculture workers, particularly from low and middle income countries (LMICs).

Aim

To gain better insight into the occupational exposures and associated occupational diseases and injuries among aquaculture workers.

Methods

MEDLINE, Google Scholar and SCOPUS literature searches were undertaken to identify relevant studies (1960–2018). Furthermore, data from official country reports, industry, labour ministries and workers' compensation boards were reviewed.

Results

The review identified that very few studies (3%) were reported from LMICs. Most studies that were reported focussed on farming fish and crustaceans, and less so molluscs and aquatic plants. Occupational exposure characterisation studies were mainly reported for noise (43.2–77.5 dB), chemicals such as formaldehyde in hatcheries (<0.045- > 2.0 ppm) and microorganisms such as E. coli bacteria in fish ponds (7.0 × 102–5.3x106CFU/100 ml). The most common occupational diseases included musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) (prevalence: 21–63%); respiratory symptoms and asthma (4–65%); skin infections (2.2–15.7%), dermatitis (6%) and urticaria (0.7%); occupational infections such as leptospirosis (incidence: 33/100,000PYS); and decompression illness in divers (incidence: 0.57–26.19/10,000PYS). Among crawfish farmers, tractor use was associated with increased risk of wrist pain (OR = 2.89) and lower-backache (OR = 2.41), while increased employment duration was associated with upper-backache (OR = 3.07). In fish farming, skin ailments were strongly associated with female gender (OR = 2.48); previous history of skin problems (OR = 8.50); waste-water exposure (OR = 2.74); fish farming-related jobs (OR = 3.47); lack of personal skin protective measures against wastewater (OR = 2.24) and work in the wet season (OR = 2.80). The most common injuries included falls (10–49/10,000 PYS), blows from an object (14–37/10,000 PYS), entanglement (29/10,000 PYS), pricks/cuts/punctures (29/10,000 PYS), high voltage exposures (8/10,000 PYS) and needlestick injuries (5 self-injections per 1,000,000 vaccinations). Seaweed farmers reported injuries mainly from hazardous aquatic animals and sharp shells on the seabed (54%). Preventive approaches based on the hierarchy of control measures to reduce health risks associated with hazardous exposures is existent mainly in predominantly well-resourced high income countries.

Conclusion

Aquaculture workers are at increased risk of developing occupational diseases and injuries attributed to various occupational hazards, and that these risks are under-reported, especially from LMICs. Future studies should explore the interaction between these environmental exposures and work organization factors in causing occupational diseases and injuries. A better understanding of key occupational risk factors and the evaluation of interventions to reduce these risks is crucial in protecting and promoting the health of workers in this sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Occupational injuries and diseases in aquaculture – A review of literature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

This article presents an overview of reported injuries in the Norwegian aquaculture industry focusing on the production of Atlantic salmon and trout, which dominates the fish farming industry in Norway. Two different data sets form the basis for the analysis: (i) occupational injuries reported to the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration, and (ii) serious occupational injuries reported to the Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority. The data sets on occupational injuries and serious injuries provide information about mode of injury, type of injury, affected body parts, and time of year of the reported injuries. The results and the injury trends are analyzed and discussed in light of important characteristics and changes in the Norwegian fish farming industry, including underreporting. This information is useful in safety management and for allocating resources for risk-reducing measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Occupational safety in aquaculture – Part 1: Injuries in Norway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article presents an overview of reported fatalities in the Norwegian aquaculture industry focusing on the production of Atlantic salmon and trout, which dominate the fish farming industry in Norway. The data on fatalities from 1982 to 2015 are registered by SINTEF Ocean, which is the only data source available. The fatality data set includes information on the incidents leading to fatalities, activities conducted at the time of fatalities and the time of year the fatalities were registered. The article discusses the fatality trends in light of the characteristics and changes in the Norwegian fish farming industry during the last three decades. This provides useful information for determining the most important current safety challenges and for developing efficient safety management in aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Occupational safety in aquaculture – Part 2: Fatalities in Norway 1982–2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study quantifies the incidence and characteristics of work-related injury and disease in the aquaculture and related service industries in Australia. Information on serious (i.e. one or more weeks off work) injury/disease claims was obtained from the National Data Set of Workers’ Compensation-based Statistics during 1 July 2012–30 June 2016. There were 295 serious injury/disease claims in the aquaculture industry and 1780 claims in the agriculture and fishing support service industries. The incidence rate for aquaculture workers was 16.0 per 1000 employees and the frequency rate was 8.5 per million hours worked over the four year period. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted for over one-third of all claims. There has been limited occupational health and safety (OHS) research in the aquaculture industry in Australia and this study represents a first step to quantify and describe the range of occupational hazards present in the industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Occupational injury and disease in the Australian aquaculture industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      This study aimed to evaluate the current status on the use of probiotics, disinfectants and antimicrobials in hatcheries, nurseries and grow‐out farms producing Pangasius catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 83 aquaculture enterprises (15 hatcheries, 32 nurseries and 36 grow‐out farms). Farmers reported use of a total of 24 different antimicrobials, e.g. for treatment of bacillary necrosis and motile aeromonad septicaemia, and a variety of disinfectants, probiotics and nutritional supplements. In contrast to small‐scale farmers, all large‐scale grow‐out farmers studied were certified and therefore had higher levels of formal education and specialized aquaculture training to diagnose and treat diseases. All farmers prepared their own medicated feed with a high risk of treatment failure, negative environmental impact from released antimicrobials and resistance development. Small‐scale farmers were at particular occupational health risks when handling antimicrobials and other chemicals, e.g. mixing medicated feed with bare hands. There is an urgent need to improve knowledge and use innovative approaches, e.g. private‐public partnerships, to assure a prudent use of chemicals, to improve capacity and access to disease diagnosis, particularly for small‐scale grow‐out farmers and nurseries. Efforts to control use of antimicrobials in aquaculture should be coordinated with the livestock and human health sectors taking an One‐Health approach.

Objective: To characterize occupational injuries of aquaculture workers in Washington State.

Methods: We reviewed accepted Washington State workers’ compensation claims from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2014. Trends in employment, worker demographics (including age, sex, and body mass index), claim rate, and injury characteristics were summarized for accepted claims in the Washington State risk classes that include aquaculture workers.

Results: During the nine-year study period, there were 1,180 accepted claims, 836 (65.1%) were medical-aid only and 344 (26.8%) were compensable. Most commonly reported injury types included being struck by/against an object (n = 420) and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (n = 310). Over the study period, there was no statistically significant change in claim rates in aquaculture (p = 0.77), though they were elevated compared to claim rates for all WA industries combined. A significant upward trend (p = 0.003) in aquaculture employment was observed during our study period.

Conclusions: Given the growth in aquaculture production, and that aquaculture workers in Washington are experiencing higher occupational injury rates compared to other workers in the state, our study suggests that the industry should devote greater attention to prevention of work-related injuries, especially those resulting in being struck by/against objects or work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Enhanced occupational safety and health programs for this industry could help reduce injuries, as well as the cost of workers’ compensation claims.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Occupational Injuries of Aquaculture Workers: Washington State,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Diseases have been recognized as the major obstacle to the shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) aquaculture production in Bangladesh. This study provides an assessment of shrimp and prawn diseases/syndromes, health management practices, and occupational health hazards associated with the handling of chemical and biological products to prevent and treat shrimp and prawn diseases. A survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire with 380 shrimp and prawn farmers in the southwest of Bangladesh during February and June of 2016. The farms were categorized on the basis of the three cropping patterns: shrimp polyculture, prawn polyculture, and shrimp and prawn polyculture. Eight different diseases and/or symptoms were reported by the surveyed farmers. The white spot disease and the broken antenna and rostrum symptom were the most common in shrimp and prawn species, respectively. In total, 35 chemical and biological products (4 antibiotics, 15 disinfectants, 13 pesticides, 2 feed additives and probiotics) were used to treat and/or prevent diseases in the all farm categories. The major constraints for disease management were limited access to disease diagnostic service, inadequate product application information and lack of knowledge on better management practices. Handling chemicals and preparation of medicated feed with bare hands was identified as a potential occupational health hazard. This study suggests improvements in farmers’ knowledge and skill in disease diagnostics and health management practices, and appropriate handling of potentially hazardous chemicals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,An assessment of health management practices and occupational health hazards in tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) aquaculture in Bangladesh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Failure of the blue revolution is a global risk. The international problem is that there is a gap in knowledge exchange between the aquaculture industry, policy makers trying to support aquaculture development and people who depend on aquaculture for a job and/or food source. Thus, governments and international organizations promoting aquaculture as the solution to improving food security, nutrition and income are failing to optimise production of natural aquatic resources.

We identify a “people–policy gap”, and suggest that this is an understudied constraint, which needs to be overcome before worldwide food security can be achieved from aquatic environments. We argue that this gap leads to uneven distribution of benefits, a disconnection between benefits and local needs, and detrimental effects on human health and food security, all of which can have negative repercussions on human communities and ecosystems. In order to address this need, we present an analytical framework to guide context specific, policy-relevant assessments of the social, economic and ecological dimensions of aquaculture on a case-by-case basis. The framework is designed to make best use of existing data and scientific tools for decision-making.

In conclusion, we argue for: equal consideration of ecological, social and economic issues in aquaculture policy-making; pre-emptive identification of likely social impacts; integration of people- and context-specific social framing conditions into planning and policy review; addressing the social disconnection between global consumption and production; and, encouragement of creative combinations of theories and methods to assess and interpret the social dimensions of aquaculture in multiple contexts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A revolution without people?

This project developed a template covering basic types of aquaculture production, health and safety hazards and risks, and related data on injuries and occupational ill health, regulations, social welfare conditions, and labour and industry activity in the sector. Profiles using the template were then produced for key aquaculture regions and nations across the globe where information could be obtained. These revealed both the scale and depth of occupational safety and health (OSH) challenges in terms of data gaps, a lack of or poor risk assessment and management, inadequate monitoring and regulation, and limited information generally about aquaculture OSH. Risks are especially high for offshore/marine aquaculture workers. Good practice as well as barriers to improving aquaculture OSH were noted. The findings from the profiles were brought together in an analysis of current knowledge on injury and work-related ill health, standards and regulation, non-work socioeconomic factors affecting aquaculture OSH, and the role of labour and industry in dealing with aquaculture OSH challenges. Some examples of governmental and labour, industry and non-governmental organisation good practice were identified. Some databases on injury and disease in the sector and research initiatives that solved problems were noted.

To foster future research directions and propose feasible adaptive management strategies, the factors affecting job satisfaction were examined in Akkeshi and Erimo, two local fishing communities in northeast Hokkaido, Japan, using historical fisheries data and semi–structured questionnaires. Fishers in Akkeshi practice mixed fisheries (capture and aquaculture), whereas in Erimo fishers specialize in capture fisheries. The target species for fisheries and aquaculture are kelp (Laminaria angustata), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) and oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in Akkeshi, and kelp and chum salmon in Erimo. The fishers in both areas were moderately satisfied with their jobs, but fishers in Erimo were more satisfied than those in Akkeshi. Satisfaction was directly associated with household size in Akkeshi and Erimo, and was high for fishers practicing oyster aquaculture in Akkeshi. Most fishers (79% in Akkeshi and 84% in Erimo) were unaware of any future target species if the current species declined or went extinct. About 14% of the respondents in Akkeshi mentioned oyster farming as their best alternative in the future. Differences in job satisfaction between the two areas may be attributed to disparities in socio–economic factors and fishery types among fishers. Further comprehensive studies that include allocation of fishing effort among different species, and impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic factors on the resources are required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Comparative job satisfaction of fishers in northeast Hokkaido, Japan for coastal fisheries management and aquaculture development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While neoliberalism is often framed as a withdrawal of the state, many scholars have noted that what is occurring is not so much a withdrawal, as a repositioning. Although many social services and regulatory functions once provided by government agencies have indeed been eroded, there has been a simultaneous channeling of new resources into other arenas, in an effort to create conditions in which private corporations can operate more profitably. This, however, often places the state in a contradictory position, simultaneously serving as regulator, investor, and development advocate for the private sector. This can become especially problematic in moments of ecological crisis when decisive and unbiased responses are needed.

With a more strategic focus, there appears to be notable conservation aquaculture potential via the cultivation of species for harvest that could provide wild harvest alleviation through replacement or supplement – particularly for over-exploited species – and/or ecosystem services, such as improved water quality and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry on the planet, aligning farming practices with conservation objectives is particularly pressing to ensure that growth happens in the service of conservation in the most effective and sustainable way possible.

Covering the open standpipes did not significantly reduce noise levels. However, placing partial tank covers over the top of the tanks above the water inlet significantly reduced noise levels, both with and without the use of standpipe covers. Noise levels in the salmon building rose from 43.2 dB without any flowing water to 77.5 dB with water flowing to all six in-ground tanks. Significant noise reductions were observed when the tanks were completely covered or with standpipe covers. Decibel levels showed the greatest reduction when the tanks and standpipes were both covered.

The impacts of aquaculture on the rural communities in terms of livelihood and food security are assessed in this paper. Aquaculture contributes to the livelihood of the poor through improved employment and income. Aquaculture creates job opportunities for rural communities, especially for illiterate women to earn side income for the household. With increased financial ability, household manage to reflect stronger purchasing power and have better access to the resources. However, there is a controversy among the researchers whether that aquaculture in rural communities is showing a pro-poor growth due to imbalance in resource distribution. In terms of food security, aquaculture of small indigenous fish in the small farmer system in rural areas provides a high quality of animal protein and essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12, calcium, and potassium. Unfortunate cases like child blindness, infant mortality and non-communicable disease (NCDs) have substantively decreased with the help of rural aquaculture. In Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT), locally-canned tuna turned out as an affordable and non-perishable food source for the remote inland residents, helping them to achieve self-sufficiency. However, when aquaculture involves farming of large-sized commercial species, problem of food insecurity resurfaced as these commercial large fish species does not bring same quantity of nutrition as compared to small fishes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Impact of Aquaculture on the Livelihoods and Food Security of Rural Communities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

In the 21st century, aquaculture is generally characterized as a foe to conservation efforts. Yet, much has changed in the two seemingly disparate practices over the last two decades, motivating an updated evaluation of the scientific evidence for how aquaculture currently impacts conservation, as well as prospects for further alignment and research. Here we present a new perspective on conservation aquaculture, which we redefine as “the use of human cultivation of an aquatic organism for the planned management and protection of a natural resource.” Looking across scales of conservation aquaculture that include single species to ecosystem level benefits (and limitations), we highlight ways aquaculture has historically, and is currently being integrated into conservation (e.g., habitat restoration of oyster beds) and areas that could be improved for the protection of critical species and habitats (e.g., aquarium trade of coral reef species). With a more strategic focus, there appears to be notable conservation aquaculture potential via the cultivation of species for harvest that could provide wild harvest alleviation through replacement or supplement – particularly for over-exploited species – and/or ecosystem services, such as improved water quality and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry on the planet, aligning farming practices with conservation objectives is particularly pressing to ensure that growth happens in the service of conservation in the most effective and sustainable way possible. The sheer potential of conservation aquaculture suggests a tale of redemption for aquaculture and opportunity for conservationists to bring in a new age of collaborative practices to address global issues.",,"ABSTRACTABSTRACTGovernment regulatory policies and social acceptance are critically important to the growth of marine aquaculture in the United States. In much of the country, opposition to marine aquaculture by local and national interest groups and local, state, tribal, or national policies have limited marine aquaculture to a scale far below its potential. There are several reason for this: (1) Marine aquaculture is relatively small, diverse, and (with some notable exceptions) unproven; (2) marine waters are public resources; (3) some Americans perceive potential negative effects of marine aquaculture without offsetting positive effects; (4) aquaculture faces significant social opposition; and (5) the governance system for leasing and regulation hinders the development of U.S. marine aquaculture. This article discusses five broad strategies and recent efforts to advance marine aquaculture in the United States: (1) fixing problems, (2) creating benefits, (3) building partnerships, (4) arguing effectively, and (5) reforming governance.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Political Economics of Marine Aquaculture in the United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Abstract
      
         
         This review focuses on the current status of antibiotics use, effects on animal health and the environment, existing policies and regulatory mechanisms in the top 15 producing countries. Fifty papers were reviewed and represented the bulk of literature worldwide. We observed that 67 antibiotic compounds were used in 11 of the 15 countries between 2008 and 2018. Among these countries, 73% applied oxytetracycline, sulphadiazine and florfenicol. On average, countries used 15 antibiotics and the top users included Vietnam (39), China (33) and Bangladesh (21). On environmental and health risks, the review revealed sufficient evidence that directly links antibiotics use to food safety, occupational health hazards and antimicrobial resistance. Environmental risks included residue accumulation, aquatic biodiversity toxicity, microbial community selection for antibiotic resistance and the emergence of multi‐antibacterial resistant strains. Regarding policies, major players were the European Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Codex and government ministries. In particular, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and Norwegian Veterinary Institute demonstrated the most outstanding regulation mechanisms of antibiotics use in aquaculture that needs to be emulated. The future of aquaculture lies in guaranteeing the supply of safe aquatic products to the growing consumer market. Thus, international coordination of the policy and regulatory environment is needed, while increased investment in research for alternative aquatic health management strategies is essential. Future technologies should focus on the reduction of antibiotics use to safeguard the environment and ensure safety of consumers, feed industry and aquaculture workers.

"Summary

Following a precise evaluation protocol that was applied to a pool of 202 articles published between 2003 and 2014, this paper evaluates the existing evidence of how and to what extent capture fisheries and aquaculture contribute to improving nutrition, food security, and economic growth in developing and emergent countries. In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries’ contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Contribution of Fisheries and Aquaculture to Food Security and Poverty Reduction: Assessing the Current Evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The Norwegian aquaculture industry has the potential to become the country’s leading ocean industry in the future. More than 99% of the produced biomass is Atlantic salmon and trout. Norwegian fish farming is characterised by operations that are susceptible to changing weather, wind and currents, and face challenges in terms of safety for fish, personnel, environment and material assets. Previous research and accident analyses reveal an incomplete knowledge of risk factors during aquaculture operations. In order to raise standards of safety in the workplace, operators need to be aware of the challenges to safety in their work environment. The objective of this paper is to describe and discuss the current status of the implementation of risk assessments in the Norwegian aquaculture industry, according to Norwegian legislation and compared with recommended requirements in the Norwegian standard for risk assessments (NS 5814). This standard largely follows ISO 31000 for risk management. We also propose, test and evaluate an improved approach to risk assessment that will ensure stronger operator involvement. Our findings demonstrate that there are several gaps between the current practice and the standard. At the present time, operator involvement is not sufficient according to the regulatory requirements of internal control. Although the approach improves critical steps in the risk assessment procedure, it remains to be implemented in the fish farming industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Risk assessments in the Norwegian aquaculture industry: Status and improved practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

Aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing food-producing sectors worldwide, making it desirable to assess the sustainability of aquaculture systems. The objective of this study was to develop a portfolio of quantitative indicators of economic, environmental and social sustainability to assess different aquaculture systems. The indicators were developed from 2003 to 2016, combining top-down and bottom-up methods, together with practical observations in experimental and commercial aquaculture facilities. A total of 56 economic (14), environmental (22) and social (20) indicators are proposed. Economic sustainability indicators reveal the degree of efficiency in using financial resources, the economic feasibility, resilience, and the capacity to absorb negative external costs and to generate funds for reinvestment. Environmental indicators reflect the use of natural resources, the efficiency in using resources, the release of pollutants and unused byproducts, and the risk of reducing biodiversity. Social sustainability indicators reflect the capacity to generate benefits for local communities, including jobs and food security, equitable income distribution, equality of opportunity, and inclusion of vulnerable populations. The indicators thus developed can be used on farm, regional, global or sectorial scales. They are quantitative, broad, scientifically sound, easy to understand and interpret, feasible to obtain on farms or on research stations, and permit comparison at different scales of space and time. Thus, they can be used to assess production systems and to compare different experimental treatments in research experiments. They also can be used by certifying organizations, investors, and policymakers. They allow performing diagnostics, identifying strengths and weaknesses, setting goals and determining actions, and assessing the effectiveness of actions and public policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Indicators of sustainability to assess aquaculture systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issues such as food safety, quality, health, animal welfare and the environment have become more important for seafood consumers and the general public in recent years, particularly in relation to aquaculture. Moving from monoculture to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), may remedy some of the concerns held by the public relating to these issues. Early studies from North America have found that consumers, and indeed the public in general, are supportive of more sustainable aquaculture production systems such as IMTA. The study described here adds to our understanding of the general public’s perceptions of aquaculture in general and IMTA in particular, providing a European perspective. Furthermore, the study identifies factors which should be considered if advancing public recognition of IMTA. 2520 web-based survey questionnaires were compiled from across five countries (Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway and the UK), aimed at investigating public understanding of aquaculture benefits and impacts, knowledge of IMTA, and also collecting demographic information. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression methods. This study determined that both positive and negative perceptions of aquaculture are held by the European general public and that they are influenced by a variety of geographic and demographic traits. The study also identified a lack of awareness of IMTA along with positive perceptions of the concept of integrated aquaculture, although the latter results should be treated with some caution. Based on the results, we conclude that there is clear scope to advance public awareness of the role of IMTA and this will be necessary to gain mainstream acceptance of this aquaculture practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Navigating uncertain waters: European public perceptions of integrated multi trophic aquaculture (IMTA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It makes up around 44 percent of total fish production globally. This increased growth of production is achieved despite facing many challenges in the aquaculture environment. Among production limiting challenges, the infectious disease takes the lion share by causing multibillion-dollar loss annually. To reduce the impact of the fish disease, it is necessary to address health constraints based on scientifically proven and recommended ways. This review aims at pointing out some of the best approaches to prevention and control of infectious disease in aquaculture. Among the effective prevention and control strategies, vaccination is one of the key practices. Types of vaccines for use in fish include killed vaccines, attenuated vaccines, DNA vaccines, recombinant technology vaccines, and synthetic peptide vaccines. Administration techniques of vaccines in fish include oral, injection, or immersion methods. Antibiotics are also in use in aquaculture despite their side effects in the development of drug resistance by microorganisms. Biological and chemical disease control strategies such as using probiotics, prebiotics, and medicinal plants are widely in use. Biosecurity measures in aquaculture can keep the safety of a facility from certain disease-causing agents that are absent in particular system. Farm-level biosecurity measures include strict quarantine measures, egg disinfection, traffic control, water treatments, clean feed, and disposal of mortalities.

                                The
first modern semi-intensive commercial farm was built by the Government in
1961. FAO fisheries statistics for 2015 indicate that of the Egyptian total
production from all sources 1.2 million tonnes (78%) are from aquaculture.
Furthermore, the fisheries trade statistics show a negative balance of trade as
Egypt imported in 2015 almost 500 000 tonnes of seafood commodities at the cost
of US $ 768.4 million while exporting only
about 32 900 tonnes valued at US $
31.7 million causing a drain on hard currencies as well as the prices of
seafood commodities in the local markets increased substantially. With a
population rapidly increasing reaching 104 million people in 2017, low
employment, rising fish prices, increasing imports of seafood commodities and
other serious developmental activities, the Government decided to embark on
large-scale integrated fin fish and shrimp aquaculture projects which aim at becoming
self-sufficient, minimize imports, job creation, reduce seafood prices in the
local market and export high value species to earn hard currencies. Two such
major projects were recently established: One at Birkat Ghalioun in the
Egyptian Nile Delta region along the Mediterranean Sea and the other is along
the East Suez Canal zone. The question remains, however, if these two mega
projects, when fully implemented, along with other small-scale aquaculture
projects across Egypt would actually achieve the developmental objectives these
projects promise as well as reduce prices of fish to local consumers?

   Abstract
   
      
      Fish is important in the diet of millions of Ghanaians supplying protein and micronutrients. Ghanaians have developed taste preferences for the consumption of Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia), thereby booming the tilapia aquaculture industry. This paper looks comprehensively at the value chain of the tilapia aquaculture sector in Ghana to identify particular areas of intervention and development opportunities in achieving food security and nutrition needs, safety, quality and trade benefits. Mixed methods (including stakeholders’ workshop, interviews and document analysis from official sources) were employed in collecting data between January and December 2014. The analysis indicates that farmed tilapia products are currently not exported but locally consumed. In 2012, approximately 28 000 t of tilapia were supplied to the local market. The bulk of the supply came from cage culture (85%) with the remaining coming from ponds and dugouts. About 98% of tilapia coming from aquaculture is supplied directly to the local markets, whilst 2% is family consumed (subsistence). The marketing channel involves farmers selling to wholesalers/retailers and to consumers/restaurants in nearby villages or secondary towns. The processing technology is generally low (mainly sun drying, small size smokers). Currently, due to the growing middle‐class Ghanaians, high domestic demand for fish and high levels of undernutrition among many poor Ghanaians, there is a good and readily available market for all sizes of tilapia produced locally. However, farmed tilapia has the potential for export to the international markets if it is processed as smoked and salted. To achieve this, there is the need to develop a practical guide for aquaculture exporters by the relevant stakeholders, strengthen capacity building of public institutions to deal with the export of aquaculture products and train more aquaculture personnel, and collate proper documentation of aquaculture products.

The marine mollusks culture is a very important activity for Brazil, generating employment and income for local people. However, little is known about the accident risks to which workers are exposed in this environment. Through an Ergonomic Work Analysis, this study identified and suggested improvements to the main risks in the activities performed on a reference farm on oyster culture. We performed observations in loco, questionnaires and interviews, analysis by infrared thermography and postural assessments by Rapid Entire Body Assessment and Strain Index methods. The performed activities involved prolonged physical effort, awkward postures, excessive static and dynamic loads, activities and repetitive movements. Many workers have muscle pains in their shoulders, lower back, hands, wrists and fingers. Electrical shock, solar radiation and drowning were also identified, and should be considered as a priority for prevention and control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Occupational health and safety management in Oyster culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to describe current chemical use practices in the aquaculture sector of Bangladesh and to identify the factors that influence them. A survey on the use of chemical and biological products was conducted between November 2011 and June 2012 using structured questionnaires administered to operators of nine farm groups, including homestead ponds, carps, tilapias, koi fish, shrimps, shrimps and prawns, prawns, rice and fish, and pangas. Farm type and farm owner characteristics were used as independent variables to explain observed chemical use. Forty-six chemical and biological products (7 water and sediment treatment compounds, 13 disinfectants, 7 antibiotics, 7 pesticides, 8 fertilizers and 4 feed additives and probiotics) were reported to be applied in aquaculture. The use of disinfectants and antibiotics was found to be highest in intensive koi and pangas farms as compared to other farm groups, whereas the use of fertilizers was lowest in these farm groups. A higher percentage of prawn and shrimp/prawn farmers applied pesticides than other farm groups. A multivariate analysis showed that patterns of use of chemical and biological products were significantly different across aquaculture farm groups, with the largest number of chemical compounds used by the intensive koi farm group. The study shows that, despite rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture in Bangladesh, use of chemical and biological products is still relatively low compared to other aquaculture producing countries in Asia. However, despite this finding, the study identified a large number of compounds that are currently in use, and that require further regulation and evaluation regarding their potential environmental and human health impacts, as already done in most developed countries.

"Abstract

Aquaculture systems are highly complex, dynamic and interconnected systems influenced by environmental, biological, cultural, socio-economic and human behavioural factors. Intensification of aquaculture production is likely to drive indiscriminate use of antibiotics to treat or prevent disease and increase productivity, often to compensate for management and husbandry deficiencies. Surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic usage (ABU) and antibiotic resistance (ABR) is often lacking or absent. Consequently, there are knowledge gaps for the risk of ABR emergence and human exposure to ABR in these systems and the wider environment. The aim of this study was to use a systems-thinking approach to map two aquaculture systems in Vietnam – striped catfish and white-leg shrimp – to identify hotspots for emergence and selection of resistance, and human exposure to antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. System mapping was conducted by stakeholders at an interdisciplinary workshop in Hanoi, Vietnam during January 2018, and the maps generated were refined until consensus. Thereafter, literature was reviewed to complement and cross-reference information and to validate the final maps. The maps and component interactions with the environment revealed the grow-out phase, where juveniles are cultured to harvest size, to be a key hotspot for emergence of ABR in both systems due to direct and indirect ABU, exposure to water contaminated with antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and duration of this stage. The pathways for human exposure to antibiotics and ABR were characterised as: occupational (on-farm and at different handling points along the value chain), through consumption (bacterial contamination and residues) and by environmental routes. By using systems thinking and mapping by stakeholders to identify hotspots we demonstrate the applicability of an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to characterising ABU in aquaculture. This work provides a foundation to quantify risks at different points, understand interactions between components, and identify stakeholders who can lead and implement change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Identifying hotspots for antibiotic resistance emergence and selection, and elucidating pathways to human exposure: Application of a systems-thinking approach to aquaculture systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Myanmar is among the world's leading aquaculture producers. But less is known about its fish farm sector than any other major aquaculture-producing country in Asia. The literature has characterized aquaculture in Myanmar as strongly export oriented, and dominated by very large farms. Past literature had it that small-scale fish farms were almost non-existent due to land use regulations that were thought to have blocked the conversion of paddy land to ponds. The past literature had it that technologies of the big farms were ‘traditional’ and extensive. We tested the conventional wisdoms, treating them as hypotheses; we did so by undertaking the largest (and first survey-based) aquaculture value chain study ever conducted in Myanmar. Our findings are as follows. 1) The great majority of farmed fish produced in Myanmar is sold to the fast growing domestic market; only a small share is exported. 2) Although large fish farms dominate in terms of total pond area, a small/medium farm segment has emerged quickly. This has given rise to a “dualistic” fish farm sector, with many small/medium farmers and nurseries alongside large farms. 3) The take-off of small/medium farms has been helped by the “informal relaxation” of restrictions prohibiting the conversion of paddy land to ponds in the main fish farming zones. 4) The upstream segments (feed and seed) of the supply chain have grown fast as have the midstream segments (wholesale and logistics).

Myanmar is among the world's leading aquaculture producers. But less is known about its fish farm sector than any other major aquaculture-producing country in Asia. The literature has characterized aquaculture in Myanmar as strongly export oriented, and dominated by very large farms. Past literature had it that small-scale fish farms were almost non-existent due to land use regulations that were thought to have blocked the conversion of paddy land to ponds.

This has given rise to a “dualistic” fish farm sector, with many small/medium farmers and nurseries alongside large farms. 3) The take-off of small/medium farms has been helped by the “informal relaxation” of restrictions prohibiting the conversion of paddy land to ponds in the main fish farming zones. 4) The upstream segments (feed and seed) of the supply chain have grown fast as have the midstream segments (wholesale and logistics).

Antibiotics are usually used in catfish farming as therapeutic and prophylactic agents. In the USA, only oxytetracycline, a combination of sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim, and florfenicol are approved by the Food Drug Administration for specific fish species (e.g., catfish and salmonids) and their specific diseases. Misuse of antibiotics as prophylactic agents in disease prevention, however, is common and contributes in the development of antibiotic resistance. Various studies had reported on antibiotic residues and/or resistance in farmed species, feral fish, water column, sediments, and, in a lesser content, among farm workers. Ninety percent of the world aquaculture production is carried out in developing countries, which lack regulations and enforcement on the use of antibiotics. Hence, efforts are needed to promote the development and enforcement of such a regulatory structure. Alternatives to antibiotics such as antibacterial vaccines, bacteriophages and their lysins, and probiotics have been applied to curtail the increasing emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to the imprudent application of antibiotics in aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Antibiotic Application and Emergence of Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) in Global Catfish Aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,

However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,

Aquaculture now accounts for over half of the world's fish for direct human consumption and is expected to approach two-thirds by 2030. With aquaculture's growth, a number of high-profile concerns have arisen, including pollution, feeding practices, disease management and antibiotic use, habitat use, non-native species, food safety, fraud, animal welfare, impacts on traditional wild fisheries, access to water and space, market competition, and genetics. Managing these concerns requires thoughtful and well-designed policies and regulations. This manuscript reviews the contributions natural resource economics has made to evaluating aquaculture policy and regulation. Despite their valuable contributions, however, economists have been largely underrepresented in the debate. The primary influencers of aquaculture policies and regulations have been traditional fisheries managers, environmental groups, and natural scientists. We identify many important areas that should be more thoroughly addressed by economists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economics of Aquaculture Policy and Regulation,,,,,,,,,

         Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock‐proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade‐offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.

However, linkages between aquaculture and food security in these systems are unclear. This study investigated the impact of emerging small-scale, business-oriented fish culture in central Bolivia on the food security and dietary diversity of aquaculture producers (n = 40) and workers (n = 26) in the value chain and compared them to local non-aquaculture farmers (n = 40). Three pathways were investigated: fish consumption, household income, and women’s participation. Food insecurity was widespread and did not vary in a statistically significant way between groups, but a trend toward greater food security amongst aquaculture producers was observed. Dietary diversity was highly homogenous, with the notable exception of high fish consumption amongst producers. Aquaculture was related to higher income, and income has a modest positive effect on food security for aquaculturists and non-aquaculture farmers, but not aquaculture value chain workers. Income did not have an effect on dietary diversity. Women’s involvement in aquaculture was correlated positively to productivity, profitability, and size of operation, while male-only aquaculture was negatively correlated to these. The value chain generated employment, especially for women, but average wages were higher for men. The research provides important insight into aquaculture-food security linkages by showing that the introduction of small-scale business-oriented aquaculture systems can provide nutritious products for regional consumption and can have positive effects on food security but is not sufficient to change local dietary preferences more broadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The contribution of small-scale, privately owned tropical aquaculture to food security and dietary diversity in Bolivia",,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The global aquaculture sector has grown continuously over the past 40 years, though unevenly among countries. Differences in factors such as inputs, climate, management, technology, markets, social environment, and institutions might be reasons for the disparities in growth. This study focuses on institutions, by analyzing the relationship between annual growth in the production of the major aquaculture countries and the quality of their institutions over three decades (1984–2013). Based on an ex-ante set of criteria, seventy-four aquaculture countries from five different regions - Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania - were selected. Annual percentage change in total aquaculture production, in terms of quantity and value, was used as a proxy for sector development. Three indices - governance, corruption, and competitiveness - were used as institutional quality proxies. Empirical results suggest that the aquaculture growth did not significantly correlate with the quality of institutions. By region, Africa had the fastest growth in the aquaculture sector, though from a low base, with 7.35% and 9.28% higher annual percentage change in aquaculture quantity and value respectively, than the Asian region. While, the European region experienced significantly lower annual percentage change in aquaculture quantity, a difference of 3.78% compared to the Asian region. Furthermore, the study found that total aquaculture production was not positively correlated with eco-label certification. The study is concluded by discussing the “aquaculture paradox.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Global aquaculture growth and institutional quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Brazil is a megadiverse country and is participant of fundamental environmental agreements for biodiversity conservation. However, the internal politics and the cultures that affect negatively the ecological integrity in Brazilian freshwater need to be improved on the condition of sustainable management. Scientific community, the government and stakeholders are in constant conflicts of goals. Meanwhile, the current model for Brazilian aquaculture shows problems of ecological impact due to the lack of appropriated planning and legislation to the aquatic biota. The non‐recognition of sustainable census incorporated in its environmental politics reflects in an archaic and unsustainable management, with the following characters: a non‐specific approach for technical management, the indiscriminate use of interspecific hybrids and non‐native species and the lack of skilled labour. The potential impact on native species and the introduction of pathogens are the main negative effects on aquatic biota. This way, the aim of this article is to elucidate the conflicts of interests and ecological effects of fish aquaculture in Brazil, besides providing good practices and sustainable alternatives for management.

"Abstract

Different seafood products based on Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fisheries and freshwater aquaculture of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) and black pacu (Colossoma macropomum), contribute at different scales to the socio-economic development, environmental degradation and nutrition of the Peruvian population. Various indicators have been used in the literature to assess the performance of these industries regarding different aspects of sustainability, notably their socio-economic performance. In this study, a novel set of indicators is proposed to evaluate the sustainability performance of these industries in Peru, based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and nutritional profiling, as well as on energy and socio-economic assessment approaches. The emphasis is put on the potential of different products to contribute to improving the nutrition of the Peruvian population in an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly and socio-economically sound way.

At the same time, we face mounting, related pressures including limited natural resources, negative environmental externalities, climate disruption, and population growth. Governments and other stakeholders are seeking strategies to boost food production efficiency and food system resiliency, and aquaculture (farmed seafood) is commonly viewed as having a major role in improving global food security based on longstanding measures of animal production efficiency. The most widely used measurement is called the 'feed conversion ratio' (FCR), which is the weight of feed administered over the lifetime of an animal divided by weight gained. By this measure, fed aquaculture and chickens are similarly efficient at converting feed into animal biomass, and both are more efficient compared to pigs and cattle. FCR does not account for differences in feed content, edible portion of an animal, or nutritional quality of the final product. Given these limitations, we searched the literature for alternative efficiency measures and identified 'nutrient retention', which can be used to compare protein and calories in feed (inputs) and edible portions of animals (outputs). Protein and calorie retention have not been calculated for most aquaculture species. Focusing on commercial production, we collected data on feed composition, feed conversion ratios, edible portions (i.e. yield), and nutritional content of edible flesh for nine aquatic and three terrestrial farmed animal species. We estimate that 19% of protein and 10% of calories in feed for aquatic species are ultimately made available in the human food supply, with significant variation between species. Comparing all terrestrial and aquatic animals in the study, chickens are most efficient using these measures, followed by Atlantic salmon. Despite lower FCRs in aquaculture, protein and calorie retention for aquaculture production is comparable to livestock production. This is, in part, due to farmed fish and shrimp requiring higher levels of protein and calories in feed compared to chickens, pigs, and cattle. Strategies to address global food security should consider these alternative efficiency measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Feed conversion efficiency in aquaculture: do we measure it correctly?,,,,,,

We calculate a Multi-Antibiotic Resistance index (MAR) of aquaculture-related bacteria (11,274 isolates) for 40 countries, of which mostly low- and middle-income countries present high AMR levels. Here we show that aquaculture MAR indices correlate with MAR indices from human clinical bacteria, temperature and countries’ climate vulnerability. We also find that infected aquatic animals present higher mortalities at warmer temperatures.

"Abstract

Sustainable intensification (SI) is defined and interpreted in terms of a framework to support production of farmed aquatic animals in Asia and their trade with Europe. A novel holistic perspective to value chain analysis, informed by a range of sustainability tools, is used to explain the dynamic in the trade that is having significant impacts on livelihoods in both regions. The origins of SI in agriculture are first described and their congruence with aquaculture clarified. Asian aquaculture systems, based on their emergent properties, are then located within a SI framework considering possible boundaries (enterprise, zone or whole value chain). The implications of conventional intensification, and alternatives are explored with reference to specific examples and impacts on the local and global environment, human and aquatic animal health and welfare. The challenges to sustainability of such value chains and implications for their governance, food culture and consumer habits are considered. Local consumption of seafood in Asia is found to be a major driver of growth and alternative markets for exports regionally and in Low and Medium income countries (LMIC) are likely to impact on employment and power in the value chain between Europe and Asia. The benefits of viewing farmed seafood as part of broader food landscapes are identified in the analysis, as is a shift in the focus from volume to value in terms of goal setting. More holistic perspectives of sustainability also emerge as necessary to describe and interpret global value chains rather than limited reductionist, production- orientated views. A diversity of trends in the development of farmed seafood is identified in contrast to any simplistic move to intensification, likely informed by economic, environmental and social factors in producer and consumer countries.

"Abstract

Aquaculture is being promoted for poverty reduction in Low Income Countries. Theoretically, aquaculture can impact poverty directly by increasing income and food security of poor fish farming households, and indirectly by generating food and economic growth. However, there is limited empirical evidence of aquaculture significantly impacting poverty, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The emerging paradigm in aquaculture development argues that indirect poverty impacts from commercial small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are greater than direct poverty impacts on small-scale producers. This paper assesses the potential poverty impacts of small-scale pond aquaculture and SME cage aquaculture in Ghana, comparing the relative significance of their direct and indirect impacts. Non-poor small-scale pond fish farmers who have been trained and/or use better management practices (BMPs) (termed fish farming type A) are found to hold the most potential to impact poverty indirectly through generating economic growth. These indirect impacts are higher than the direct impacts on poor small-scale fish farmers and the indirect impacts from SMEs. The findings support the current move away from a narrow focus on poor producers. However, it is unclear whether the arguments for expanding support to include SMEs are fully supported due to the ambiguity of standard fish farmer categories. If type A fish farmers are categorised as ‘commercial micro enterprises’ the findings support the paradigm shift. However, it is more likely that these farmers lie between ‘non commercial’ and ‘commercial’ categories. A more nuanced approach to aquaculture development, accounting for the wide spectrum of farmers whose characteristics differ between contexts, is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A comparative assessment of the poverty impacts of pond and cage aquaculture in Ghana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to much research to date, the papers addressing these themes show how the expansion of aquaculture has resulted highly diverse configurations of production for consumption in the global South. Collectively, the papers highlight the need for greater attention to neglected value chain segments and categories of actor, modes of production, regulation, and innovation, and patterns of access to benefits. The papers synthesized also affirm the need for more rigorous and diverse future value chain research to illuminate the aquaculture sector's ongoing development, and contribute to the sustainable expansion as an increasingly important component of the global food system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerging trends in aquaculture value chain research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we model and map the effect of warming ocean conditions (Representative Concentration Pathway scenario 8.5) on marine aquaculture production potential over the next century, based on thermal tolerance and growth data of 180 cultured finfish and bivalve species. We find heterogeneous patterns of gains and losses, but an overall greater probability of declines worldwide. Accounting for multiple drivers of species growth, including shifts in temperature, chlorophyll and ocean acidification, reveals potentially greater declines in bivalve aquaculture compared with finfish production. This study addresses a missing component in food security research and sustainable development planning by identifying regions that will face potentially greater climate change challenges and resilience with regards to marine aquaculture in the coming decades.

Here, we assess and highlight development challenges for fisheries-dependent countries based on analyses of interactions and trade-offs between goals focusing on food, biodiversity and climate change. We demonstrate that some countries are likely to face double jeopardies in both fisheries and agriculture sectors under climate change. The strategies to mitigate these risks will be context-dependent, and will need to directly address the trade-offs among Sustainable Development Goals, such as halting biodiversity loss and reducing poverty. Countries with low adaptive capacity but increasing demand for food require greater support and capacity building to transition towards reconciling trade-offs. Necessary actions are context-dependent and include effective governance, improved management and conservation, maximizing societal and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability of distribution and innovation in food production, including continued development of low input and low impact aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Linked sustainability challenges and trade-offs among fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture",,,,,,,,,,

Yet, most fed aquaculture species (finfish and crustacea) rely on wild-captured forage fish for essential fatty acids and micronutrients, an important but limited resource. As the fastest growing food sector in the world, fed aquaculture demand will eventually surpass ecological supply of forage fish, but when and how best to avoid this ecological boundary is unclear. Using global production data, feed use trends, and human consumption patterns, we show how combined actions of fisheries reform, reduced feed use by non-carnivorous aquaculture and agricultural species, and greater consistent inclusion of fish by-products in China-based production can circumvent forage fish limits by mid-century. However, we also demonstrate that the efficacies of such actions are diminished if global diets shift to more seafood-heavy (that is, pescatarian) diets and are further constrained by possible ecosystem-based fisheries regulations in the future. Long-term, nutrient-equivalent alternative feed sources are essential for more rapid and certain aquaculture sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Avoiding the ecological limits of forage fish for fed aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,

Genome polyploidy has been revealed to result in evolutionary advantages and novelties, and therefore, polyploid aquatic animals may possess excellent traits of economic interest including rapid growth, extensive adaptability and disease resistance. For this reason, numerous species of natural polyploid fishes, such as common carp, gibel carp, crucian carp, salmon, and sturgeon, were chosen as important target species for aquaculture. Many artificial polyploids have been commercially utilized for aquaculture and most of them were created from natural polyploid fishes of the Cyprinidae and Salmonidae. Thanks to the easy mass production and better economic traits in growth and flesh quality, the synthetized autopolyploids or allopolyploids from natural polyploid species in cyprinid fishes have been extensively applied to aquaculture throughout China. This review outlines polyploidy advantages and innovative opportunities, lists natural polyploid species used in aquaculture, and summarizes artificial polyploids that have been induced or synthetized, and used in aquaculture. Moreover, some main research trends on polyploid utilization and ploidy manipulation of aquaculture animals are also introduced and discussed in the review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Natural and artificial polyploids in aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been put forward as a potential sustainable alternative to single fin fish species aquaculture. In IMTA, several species are combined in the production process. Integrating species has a conceivable dual advantage; the environmental impact can be lowered through nutrient cycling and from an economic perspective there is potential for increased efficiency, product diversification and a higher willingness to pay for more environmentally friendly produced salmon. This paper presents the results from a choice experiment which examines whether the Irish public is willing to pay a premium for “sustainably produced” farmed salmon from an IMTA process. Uniquely, an ecolabel was used in the design, based on familiar energy rating labels, to communicate the environmental pressure of fish farming to respondents. The experiment demonstrates that the Irish public has a willingness to pay a price premium for sustainability in salmon farming and for locally produced salmon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Estimating the Irish public's willingness to pay for more sustainable salmon produced by integrated multi-trophic aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth of aquaculture and the increasing demand of farmed fish have led to a rise in the price of fishmeal and fish oil used in fish feeding during the last years. The experimental use of insect meal as a sustainable alternative to fish meal has recently grown. Insects are easy to rear, have a small ecological impact and have high protein content. The present work analyzes through a Discrete Choice Experiment method, the preferences and willingness to pay of Spanish consumers towards an aquaculture production system based on this protein source as ingredient in aquafeed, using the gilthead seabream as a case study. It also analyzes the information level of consumers about aquaculture and their perceptions towards its environmental impact compared to other animal production systems. This study also summarizes research advances regarding the insect meals as substitutes or complements for fish meals focusing on fish species of interest in Spain and Europe. Special emphasis was made on the limitation of their use, its impact towards the conversion feed ratio and its main nutritional problems for fish feeding, such as fatty acids and chitin. The studies showed that the use of insect meal, in particular, from the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens), the common housefly (Musca domestica) and the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) as an alternative of feeding in aquaculture seems to be promising both at technical-productive level and at consumer acceptance level. Results showed that Spanish consumers were willing to pay a premium for this type of fish compared to fish produced with the current feeding systems.

The monitoring of farming processes can optimize the use of resources and improve its sustainability and profitability. In fish farms, the water quality, tank environment, and fish behavior must be monitored. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a promising option to perform this monitoring. Nevertheless, its high cost is slowing the expansion of its use. In this paper, we propose a set of sensors for monitoring the water quality and fish behavior in aquaculture tanks during the feeding process. The WSN is based on physical sensors, composed of simple electronic components. The system proposed can monitor water quality parameters, tank status, the feed falling and fish swimming depth and velocity. In addition, the system includes a smart algorithm to reduce the energy waste when sending the information from the node to the database. The system is composed of three nodes in each tank that send the information though the local area network to a database on the Internet and a smart algorithm that detects abnormal values and sends alarms when they happen. All the sensors are designed, calibrated, and deployed to ensure its suitability. The greatest efforts have been accomplished with the fish presence sensor. The total cost of the sensors and nodes for the proposed system is less than 90 €.

"Abstract

In the context of climate change and population growth, aquaculture plays an important role for food security, employment and economic development. Intensive recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) allow to treat and recycle fish effluents to reduce waste concentration in outflow water thereby reducing environmental contamination. RAS sustainability may be further improved using aquaponics, a circular productive system in which RAS wastewater is recovered for crop cultivation and recycled back to the fish tanks. In this study, water metabolism of a catfish RAS was assessed and the opportunity to produce lettuce with the RAS effluent was tested. Crop growth and water consumption in aquaponics were compared to those experienced in hydroponics at three nutrient solution concentration (EC of 1.6, 2.0 and 3.0 dS∙m−1), also considering water- (WUE) and nitrogen- use efficiency (NUE). A scenario for converting the RAS in a catfish-lettuce aquaponic system was, then, proposed.

The RAS water balance included an input of 555 L∙day−1, out of which 32 L∙day−1 were lost by evaporation from the tubs whereas 460 L∙day−1 were discarded. The lettuce yield, NUE and WUE in aquaponics were respectively 20.3%, 22.3% and 20.6% lower than those obtained in hydroponics. Best performances in hydroponics were achieved with EC of 2.0 dS m−1. No difference in term of water consumption arose between the treatments, with average water use of 46 mL∙plant−1∙day−1.

Considering the current RAS productivity of 329 kg year−1, a 10 m2 raft system hosting 160 lettuces would satisfy the nitrogen filtration demand. Once closed the water loop between the two productive sub-units, the current water input of 532 L∙day−1 could be reduced to the amount needed to replace the water lost by evaporation (50 L∙day−1) and the RAS water output would decrease from 555 to 103 L∙day−1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Improving water management in European catfish recirculating aquaculture systems through catfish-lettuce aquaponics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

            Seaweeds have been used as a food for centuries in Asia and are increasingly exploited as a source for dietary supplements, animal feed, chemicals, and biofuels. In recent years, there has been an increase in the prevalence of diseases and pests in these aquaculture crops, with a subsequent reduction in their quantity and commercial value. In this article, we review diseases that have been reported in the scientific literature for species of red and brown seaweeds. We have focused on the major seaweed crops grown in Asia, where much of this production is centered. We also provide information on disease management and biosecurity and some observations on future directions.

Social licence is a concept and practice that emerged in the mining sector to improve community industry relations, but is now spreading to other sectors including aquaculture. This paper examines the gap between recent research on aquaculture and social licence, and a large and complex body of scholarship on social licence in mining and other resource intensive industries. This gap provides the basis for a research agenda for social licence in aquaculture that engages with critical debates in mining, while being sensitive to the sectoral differences between mining and aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Social licence and aquaculture: Towards a research agenda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

            Numerical abundance and biomass values presented here for Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, Chum Salmon O. keta, and Sockeye Salmon O. nerka in the North Pacific Ocean span 90 years (1925–2015), representing the most comprehensive compilation of these data to date. In contrast to less populous species of salmon, these species are more abundant now than ever, averaging 665 × 106 adult salmon each year (1.32 × 106 metric tons) during 1990–2015. When immature salmon are included, recent biomass estimates approach 5 × 106 metric tons. Following an initial peak during 1934–1943, abundances were low until the 1977 regime shift benefited each species. During 1990–2015, Pink Salmon dominated adult abundance (67% of total) and biomass (48%), followed by Chum Salmon (20%, 35%) and Sockeye Salmon (13%, 17%). Alaska produced approximately 39% of all Pink Salmon, 22% of Chum Salmon, and 69% of Sockeye Salmon, while Japan and Russia produced most of the remainder. Although production of natural‐origin salmon is currently high due to generally favorable ocean conditions in northern regions, approximately 60% of Chum Salmon, 15% of Pink Salmon, and 4% of Sockeye Salmon during 1990–2015 were of hatchery origin. Alaska generated 68% and 95% of hatchery Pink Salmon and Sockeye Salmon, respectively, while Japan produced 75% of hatchery Chum Salmon. Salmon abundance in large areas of Alaska (Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska), Russia (Sakhalin and Kuril islands), Japan, and South Korea are dominated by hatchery salmon. During 1990–2015, hatchery salmon represented approximately 40% of the total biomass of adult and immature salmon in the ocean. Density‐dependent effects are apparent, and carrying capacity may have been reached in recent decades, but interaction effects between hatchery‐ and natural‐origin salmon are difficult to quantify, in part because these fish are rarely separated in catch and escapement statistics. The following management changes are recommended: (1) mark or tag hatchery salmon so that they can be identified after release, (2) estimate hatchery‐ and natural‐origin salmon in catches and escapement, and (3) maintain these statistics in publicly accessible databases.

            Numerical abundance and biomass values presented here for Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, Chum Salmon O. keta, and Sockeye Salmon O. nerka in the North Pacific Ocean span 90 years (1925–2015), representing the most comprehensive compilation of these data to date. In contrast to less populous species of salmon, these species are more abundant now than ever, averaging 665 × 106 adult salmon each year (1.32 × 106 metric tons) during 1990–2015. When immature salmon are included, recent biomass estimates approach 5 × 106 metric tons. Following an initial peak during 1934–1943, abundances were low until the 1977 regime shift benefited each species. During 1990–2015, Pink Salmon dominated adult abundance (67% of total) and biomass (48%), followed by Chum Salmon (20%, 35%) and Sockeye Salmon (13%, 17%). Alaska produced approximately 39% of all Pink Salmon, 22% of Chum Salmon, and 69% of Sockeye Salmon, while Japan and Russia produced most of the remainder.

These results were compared with a group of control chickens from the same hatchery and incubator that did not go through the commercial hatchery routine. Chickens were continuously weighed, egg production data was collected and feather scoring was performed. We found that chicks have a significant increase in CORT during the hatchery process, which implies they are exposed to stress. During first weeks of life, these chicks were more fearful, had a higher CORT reactivity during restraint and weighed more than control chicks. Later in life, hatchery treated chickens had more feather damages and injuries on combs and wattles, a faster onset of egg laying and higher levels of estradiol. We conclude that processing at the commercial hatchery was a stressful event with short- and long-term effects on behaviour and stress reactivity, and potentially also positive effects on production.

AR5 underlined key uncertainties that remain regarding how synergistic changes in the ocean are likely to affect human systems, and how humans are likely to respond to these events. As climate change research has accelerated rapidly following AR5, an updated synthesis of available knowledge is necessary to identify emerging evidence, and to thereby better inform policy discussions. This paper reviews the literature to capture corroborating, conflicting, and novel findings published following the cut-off date for contribution to AR5. Specifically, we highlight key scientific developments on the impacts of climate-induced changes in the ocean on key socioeconomic sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism. New evidence continues to support a climate-induced redistribution of benefits and losses at multiple scales and across coastal and marine socio-ecological systems, partly resulting from species and ecosystem range shifts and changes in primary productivity. New efforts have been made to characterize and value ecosystem services in the context of climate change, with specific relevance to ecosystem-based adaptation. Recent studies have also explored synergistic interactions between climatic drivers, and have found strong variability between impacts on species at different life stages. Although climate change may improve conditions for some types of freshwater aquaculture, potentially providing alternative opportunities to adapt to impacts on wild capture fisheries, ocean acidification poses a risk to shellfish fisheries and aquaculture. The risk of increased prevalence of disease under warmer temperatures is uncertain, and may detrimentally affect human health. Climate change may also induce changes in tourism flows, leading to substantial geospatial shifts in economic costs and benefits associated with tourism revenue and coastal infrastructure protection and repairs. While promising, ecosystem-based coastal adaptation approaches are still emerging, and require an improved understanding of key ecosystem services, and values for coastal communities in order to assess risk, aid coastal development planning, and build decision support systems.",,,TOTAL VIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Observed and Projected Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Fisheries, Aquaculture, Coastal Tourism, and Human Health: An Update",,

The first key area is environmental manipulation, where the intention is to induce an ‘epigenetic memory’ either within or between generations to produce a desired phenotype. The second key area is epigenetic selection, which, alone or combined with genetic selection, may increase the reliability of producing animals with desired phenotypes. Based on aspects of life history and husbandry practices in aquaculture species, the application of epigenetic knowledge could significantly affect the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture practices. Conversely, clarifying the role of epigenetic mechanisms in aquaculture species may upend traditional assumptions about selection practices.

         In integrated multi‐trophic aquaculture (IMTA), species from different trophic levels are raised in proximity to one another and the co‐products (organic and inorganic wastes) of one cultured species are recycled to serve as nutritional inputs for others. IMTA can reduce the ecological impacts near aquaculture operations, improve social perceptions of aquaculture and provide financial benefits for aquaculture producers via product diversification, faster production cycles and price premiums on IMTA products. We review aspects of IMTA’s economic potential and market acceptance and consider ways to address the current gaps in our understanding. We find that adopting IMTA raises the assimilative capacity of the farm and that IMTA substantively reduces the environmental cost of aquaculture. Moreover, integrating extractive species (e.g. invertebrates and/or seaweeds), with existing fed‐monoculture operations, can increase farm profits. The presence of positive public attitudes towards IMTA, as expressed by a willingness to pay a premium for its products, can further increase the profitability of adopting IMTA. Areas requiring more economic research include the development of comparative bioeconomic models of IMTA and the evaluation of competing production systems and their ability to internalize externalities to demonstrate the true value of IMTA to society. Further exploration of economic incentives, such as instruments needed to foster adoption of IMTA, and investigation of marketing opportunities, such as promoting the eco‐certification of IMTA products, are also needed. Our paper aimed to inform economists and non‐economists alike about the latest developments in IMTA economics, and spur further research on critical topics concerning this important subject.

"Abstract

Efforts to expand the marine aquaculture industry often draw on a discourse of opportunity that highlights untapped potential for economic growth. This discourse also underlies the more general concept of Blue Economy in which oceans are a frontier for economic development. Marine aquaculture is seen as an important part of Blue Economy, but the current discourse overlooks evidence that straightforward trickle-down effects—from aggregate economic growth at the national level to holistic benefits at the community level—rarely exist for marine aquaculture. Using the case of marine aquaculture in the United States, we argue that a shift in focus to community wellbeing is necessary to realize the potential benefits of marine aquaculture expansion. More generally, we suggest that marine aquaculture illustrates the need to reorient Blue Economy to Blue Communities, a concept that draws on the multidimensional concept of wellbeing to foreground social, cultural, and environmental factors alongside economic growth. With attention to just and equitable governance embedded in place and context, marine aquaculture can grow in ways that enhance wellbeing in Blue Communities while supporting broader economic development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,From Blue Economy to Blue Communities: reorienting aquaculture expansion for community wellbeing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on an interview-based case study of the aquaculture industry in New Zealand, this paper describes the motivations for seeking social licence, the approaches that have been adopted, the outcomes sought and the challenges faced by those involved. The findings are discussed in a framework of relationship typology – transactional or relational. We find that those companies and communities that are able to form more relational relationships are more likely to gain community buy-in and thus a social licence. Our findings indicate that relationship type is related to scale, and that there are lessons that large-scale companies can incorporate into their business models that enable them to build relational relationships, gaining social licence and thus operating more sustainably.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The role of relationships in achieving and maintaining a social licence in the New Zealand aquaculture sector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As shellfish aquaculture activities grow in the US, researchers, practitioners, resource users, and others have questioned how much development can be accommodated by natural and social systems. In a unique application of the normative evaluation approach to shellfish aquaculture development, this study uses data from a mail survey to (1) examine Rhode Islanders’ support for aquaculture in general and in RI waters; (2) investigate how different features of an aquaculture farm influence normative evaluations; and (3) explore areas of agreement and disagreement among stakeholder groups for social carrying capacities associated with aquaculture in RI coastal waters. Findings demonstrate that respondents do not strictly support or oppose aquaculture development; instead support depends on the waterbody where the aquaculture is occurring, the amount of area used for aquaculture, and ways in which aquaculture is conducted. Social norm curves show that levels of acceptabilities for shellfish aquaculture development in two RI waterbodies decline with increasing levels of aquaculture activities. Comparisons among sub-sets of respondents highlight disagreement among groups on the level beyond which shellfish aquaculture development is no longer acceptable (social carrying capacity). Results from normative evaluation studies can be used in combination with physical, ecological, and biological carrying capacities; management goals and objectives; other resource uses and values; and desired social and ecological conditions to inform policy discussions about shellfish aquaculture development in coastal waters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Using normative evaluations to plan for and manage shellfish aquaculture development in Rhode Island coastal waters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uptake of the the government of Thailand's three national certification standards for shrimp aquaculture (CoC, GAP and GAP-7401) has remained limited. Using the Devil's Triangle framework, which highlights tradeoffs between accessibility, credibility and improvement, this paper examines the Thai government's rationale for developing these national certification standards, and compares this rationale with farmers' perceptions surrounding standard compliance. The findings demonstrate that different groups of farmers experience different tradeoffs between accessibility, credibility and improvement under each of the three standards. The paper concludes that improved coordination of these national certification standards could promote credible and inclusive step-wise improvement pathways for the Thai shrimp industry as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Implications of multiple national certification standards for Thai shrimp aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   Abstract
   
      
      Aquaculture is the main vector for introduction of non‐native species in Brazil and around the world. Despite the potentially serious and irreversible ecological impacts caused by non‐native species, they continue to be in many cases the preferred option in aquaculture farms, of which the recent plans of aquaculture expansion promoted by the Brazilian Government are an emblematic example. In this study, we present a survey of publicly available information on aquaculture parks to be installed across the Brazilian territory, with emphasis on species status as native or non‐native, and discuss the implications for the conservation of aquatic biodiversity. One hundred and thirty‐nine aquaculture parks (APs), with a total of 1556 sites covering 941.38 hectares, have been called for bids. Among these, 122 APs will contain at least one non‐native species, and 68 APs will be based exclusively on their cultivation. A predictable consequence is the enhancement of propagule pressure in surrounding aquatic ecosystems, increasing the risk of non‐native species establishment or persistence, which will likely intensify the environmental impacts already in course in four major river basins and along the Brazilian coast. These impacts will add up to more direct effects of aquaculture farming – for example elevated input of nutrients and organic matter – and include changes in habitat and water quality, spread of diseases, biotic homogenization, loss of population viability resulting from hybridization and outbreeding depression, and the local extirpation of native species.

Estimating antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance development risks in environmental compartments is important to design management strategies that advance our stewardship of antibiotics. In this study we propose a modelling approach to estimate the risk of antibiotic resistance development in environmental compartments and demonstrate its application in aquaculture production systems. We modelled exposure concentrations for 12 antibiotics used in Vietnamese Pangasius catfish production using the ERA-AQUA model. Minimum selective concentration (MSC) distributions that characterize the selective pressure of antibiotics on bacterial communities were derived from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) Minimum Inhibitory Concentration dataset. The antibiotic resistance development risk (RDR) for each antibiotic was calculated as the probability that the antibiotic exposure distribution exceeds the MSC distribution representing the bacterial community. RDRs in pond sediments were nearly 100% for all antibiotics. Median RDR values in pond water were high for the majority of the antibiotics, with rifampicin, levofloxacin and ampicillin having highest values. In the effluent mixing area, RDRs were low for most antibiotics, with the exception of amoxicillin, ampicillin and trimethoprim, which presented moderate risks, and rifampicin and levofloxacin, which presented high risks. The RDR provides an efficient means to benchmark multiple antibiotics and treatment regimes in the initial phase of a risk assessment with regards to their potential to develop resistance in different environmental compartments, and can be used to derive resistance threshold concentrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A probabilistic approach to assess antibiotic resistance development risks in environmental compartments and its application to an intensive aquaculture production scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      This study provides an overview of successful genetic improvement programmes for important farmed aquaculture species in Asia, with a focus on lessons and experiences gained as well as challenges remaining. In both fish and prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), conventional selective breeding approaches have resulted in significant improvement in productivity, with genetic gains ranging from 8 to 12% per generation. Selection for high growth has also brought about beneficial changes in fillet weight of fish and edible meat in prawns without detrimental effects on flesh quality attributes and fitness‐related traits. Genetically improved animals show remarkable vigour and high adaptation to a range of culture environments/conditions in Asian countries. Despite these successes, however, the conduct and practical implementation of such breeding programmes still present several challenges. These include the expansion of breeding objectives, management of inbreeding in closed‐selection populations, controlling the effects of genotype by environment interactions, simultaneous production of large number of full‐ and half‐sib families for species with asynchronous spawning behaviour, maintaining pedigree records, dissemination of the improved strains for widespread production, as well as a reluctance by many to carry out systematically designed genetic improvement for aquatic animal species. There are also challenges with regard to the application of genomic information in genetic enhancement programmes and the development of genetically improved strains in response to climate and environmental changes. In this study, each of these challenges is discussed and solutions are proposed to increase efficiency of future genetic improvement programmes for economically important aquaculture species.

         High rates of prespawn mortality, when adult salmon die after completing migration but prior to spawning, can lead to population declines and can impede recovery of threatened stocks. In this study, annual prespawn mortality of female Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ranged from 1% to 100% over 14 years in seven study reaches located throughout the upper Willamette River basin, Oregon. Prespawn mortality rates were positively correlated with the annual maximum 7‐d average maximum stream temperature and the percentage of spawning fish of hatchery origin. Observed prespawn mortality rates varied considerably, but annual female prespawn rates were consistently >80% where maximum temperatures exceeded 20°C and the composition of spawning fish was >80% hatchery origin. In several spawning tributaries, prespawn mortality rates generally decreased at higher elevations. The proximate cause of prespawn death was not evaluated here, and observed patterns likely reflected additional factors that influence mortality either directly or indirectly, such as handling, dam passage, fishing pressure, instream habitat, energetic budget, fish density, and pathogen loads.

"Abstract

To address the undesired effect of chemotherapeutants in aquaculture, ozone has been suggested as an alternative to improve water quality. To ensure safe and robust treatment, it is vital to define the ozone demand and ozone kinetics of the specific water matrix to avoid ozone overdose. Different ozone dosages were applied to water in freshwater recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Experiments were performed to investigate ozone kinetics and demand, and to evaluate the effects on the water quality, particularly in relation to fluorescent organic matter. This study aimed at predicting a suitable ozone dosage for water treatment based on daily ozone demand via laboratory studies. These ozone dosages will be eventually applied and maintained at these levels in pilot-scale RAS to verify predictions. Selected water quality parameters were measured, including natural fluorescence and organic compound concentration changes during ozonation. Ozone reactions were described by first order kinetics. Organic matter, assessed as chemical oxygen demand and fluorescence, decreased by 25% (low O3), 30% (middle O3) and 53% (high O3), while water transmittance improved by 15% over an 8-day period. No fish mortality was observed. Overall, this study confirms that ozone can improve RAS water quality, provides a better understanding of the ozone decay mechanisms that can be used to define further safe ozone treatment margins, and that fluorescence could be used as a monitoring tool to control ozone. This study might be used as a tool to design ozone systems for full-scale RAS by analysing water sample from the specific RAS in the laboratory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ozonation control and effects of ozone on water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combinations of stocking density and aquaculture cycle length that maximize cumulative, discounted profit are identified for two prawn species in sub-Saharan Africa: the endemic, non-domesticated Macrobrachium vollenhovenii and the non-native, domesticated Macrobrachium rosenbergii. At profit-maximizing densities, both M. rosenbergii and M. vollenhovenii may substantially reduce intermediate host snail populations and aid schistosomiasis control efforts.

"Abstract

Recurring epidemics and the emergence of new aquatic diseases are increasingly threatening the growth of aquaculture. The fast pace of aquaculture development and on-going global environmental, social and economic change are challenging epidemiologists in their capacity to surveil and control the spread of diseases and avert losses to farmers and impacts on their livelihoods and environment. By placing farmers as the starting point of disease surveillance, we contend that farmer-based syndromic disease surveillance holds potential to overcome the current limitations of conventional disease surveillance, and demonstrate its relevance for aquaculture, particularly in resource constrained environments. Drawing on the literature on aquaculture, epidemiology, farmers' decision-making, technology adoption in animal health management and participation in animal disease surveillance, we highlight the complex interplay of behavioural (economic and social) factors behind farmers' reporting of disease. To this we add insights from institutional economics to analyse the constraints and dilemmas disease surveillance poses to institutions. Whilst information technologies are playing a significant supporting role in disease surveillance, our central argument is that if data collection for epidemiological monitoring is about technology, surveillance itself is about people. Stakeholder involvement and perception of surveillance benefits, value of epidemiological data collected, farmers' knowledge, motivation and trust and institutions' functioning are key considerations in the design of successful syndromic disease surveillance programmes. These human dimensions constitute important knowledge gaps in animal disease surveillance in general, and in particular in aquaculture. Interdisciplinary collaboration in disease surveillance is essential. It is crucial in an environment where diseases are emerging and spreading in increasingly complex, interconnected and dynamic social-ecological systems and is the key to unlocking the numerous benefits of farmer-based syndromic aquatic disease surveillance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,People matter in animal disease surveillance: Challenges and opportunities for the aquaculture sector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mariculture is a relatively new activity that is expanding globally and interacts with other coastal uses. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate suitable sites from environmental, economic and social points of view, involving different stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, in the Ligurian Sea (Italy), for its environmental characteristics and tradition, fish farming should be further boosted and an accurate marine spatial planning should be done. This paper presents a spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) addressed to identify suitable areas for siting offshore medium size fish farms in the Ligurian Sea at the regional scale. The SMCE procedure follows an integrated approach that can be potentially adapted and applied to any coastal system. The site selection is based on the definition of criteria that assess their suitability and on conditions related to the entire study area. Suitability values are ranked on a scale from 1 (suitable) to 10 (optimal). More than 9000 ha were identified and almost 40% of this area gets high suitability values, from 7 to 9, pointing out the untapped potential for Ligurian marine coastal zone. Results demonstrate that our SMCE, and in particular its procedure, allows identifying the most suitable areas in an easy and quick way and solving effectively the complex spatial problem of suitable site selection for fish farming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A spatial multi-criteria evaluation for site selection of offshore marine fish farm in the Ligurian Sea, Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Effective population size (Ne) is among the most important metrics in evolutionary biology. In natural populations, it is often difficult to collect adequate demographic data to calculate Ne directly. Consequently, genetic methods to estimate Ne have been developed. Two Ne estimators based on sibship reconstruction using multilocus genotype data have been developed in recent years: sibship assignment and parentage analysis without parents. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of sibship reconstruction using a large empirical dataset from five hatchery steelhead populations with known pedigrees and using 95 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We challenged the software COLONY with 2,599,961 known relationships and demonstrated that reconstruction of full‐sib and unrelated pairs was greater than 95% and 99% accurate, respectively. However, reconstruction of half‐sib pairs was poor (<5% accurate). Despite poor half‐sib reconstruction, both estimators provided accurate estimates of the effective number of breeders (Nb) when sample sizes were near or greater than the true Nb and when assuming a monogamous mating system. We further demonstrated that both methods provide roughly equivalent estimates of Nb. Our results indicate that sibship reconstruction and current SNP panels provide promise for estimating Nb in steelhead populations in the region.

Freshwater aquaculture provides employment and offers often reliable income to impecunious communities in the Sundarban delta of India, a UNESCO declared world heritage site while it has been threatened by recent environmental and climatic changes. Based on household survey our study provides data on i) how local farmers perceive climate change in general, ii) prevailing freshwater aquaculture scenarios and potential impacts of the climate change on aquaculture, and iii) which strategies aquaculture farmers employ to cope with the perceived risks. The study reveals that farmers are aware of climatic variability and express their experiences of changes in temperature, rainfall, tropical cyclones and sea level rise. The production methods of freshwater aquaculture in Sundarban can be termed as ‘semi-improved low-input carp polyculture’. Cyclones and storm surges are the most significant climatic phenomena and severely affect freshwater aquaculture due to subsequent coastal flooding, and sea-level rise that cumulatively lead to salinity intrusion, followed by rising air temperature and drought. In relation to perceived risks, farmers are currently dealing with the problems through short-term coping measures which need scientific improvements to give long-term relief to the farmers. Considering the effects of climate change on freshwater pond aquaculture in the delta, we propose some preliminary policy recommendations that need to be introduced to cope with the challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Farmers’ perceptions of climate change, impacts on freshwater aquaculture and adaptation strategies in climatic change hotspots: A case of the Indian Sundarban delta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antimicrobials are important to treat diseases in aquaculture and the objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of antimicrobial products commonly used in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) aquaculture in Northern Vietnam. A total of 25 antimicrobial products were obtained from 20 chemical shops including 12 products declared to contain a single antimicrobial, nine products with a mixture of two different antimicrobials and four products containing a mixture of three different antimicrobials. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry was used to analyse the concentration of the declared antimicrobials. Results revealed that only 1/12 products with a single antimicrobial contained an active substance within ± 10% (accepted level of variation) of the concentration declared on the product label. More than half of the products contained antimicrobial concentrations within < 1.0% to 90% of the declared concentration. The majority of the products provided inadequate or incorrect information on specific diseases to be treated, instructions on how to prepare medicated feed, withdrawal time, as well as instructions about personal protection measures. The documented poor quality of antimicrobial products and inadequate labelling has negative impacts on effective disease treatment; contribute to development of antimicrobial resistance, and the use of such products is associated with food safety and occupational health hazards. There is an urgent need to strengthen diagnostic services, legislation and control of antimicrobial products in shrimp aquaculture and educate farmers on prudent antimicrobial use practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Quality of antimicrobial products used in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) aquaculture in Northern Vietnam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

European seas are encountering an upsurge in competing marine activities and infrastructures. Traditional exploitation such as fisheries, tourism, transportation, and oil production are accompanied by new sustainable economic activities such as offshore windfarms, aquaculture, and tidal and wave energy. One proposed solution to overcome possible competing claims at sea lies in combining these economic activities as part of Multi-Use Platforms at Sea (MUPS). MUPS can be understood as areas at sea, designated for a combination of activities, either completely integrated in a platform or in shared marine space. MUPS can potentially benefit from each other in terms of infrastructure, maintenance, etc. Developing MUPS in the marine environment demands adequate governance. In this article, we investigate four European sites to find out how governance arrangements may facilitate or complicate MUPs. In particular, we apply a framework specifying policy, economic, social, technical, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) factors to explore governance arrangements in four case study sites in different sea basins around Europe (the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea). The article concludes with policy recommendations on a governance regime for facilitating the development of MUPS in the future.

The concentration of metals in all the analyzed samples was found higher during pre-monsoon season. While, in case of fish, L. bata species has higher metal accumulation rate during both the seasons than the L. rohita because of their bottom dweller feeding habit. The order of metals in L. bata muscles is Zn > Mn > Pb > Cr > As > Cd.

"Abstract

Antimicrobials are important to treat diseases in aquaculture and the objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of antimicrobial products commonly used in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) aquaculture in Northern Vietnam. A total of 25 antimicrobial products were obtained from 20 chemical shops including 12 products declared to contain a single antimicrobial, nine products with a mixture of two different antimicrobials and four products containing a mixture of three different antimicrobials. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry was used to analyse the concentration of the declared antimicrobials. Results revealed that only 1/12 products with a single antimicrobial contained an active substance within ± 10% (accepted level of variation) of the concentration declared on the product label. More than half of the products contained antimicrobial concentrations within < 1.0% to 90% of the declared concentration. The majority of the products provided inadequate or incorrect information on specific diseases to be treated, instructions on how to prepare medicated feed, withdrawal time, as well as instructions about personal protection measures. The documented poor quality of antimicrobial products and inadequate labelling has negative impacts on effective disease treatment; contribute to development of antimicrobial resistance, and the use of such products is associated with food safety and occupational health hazards. There is an urgent need to strengthen diagnostic services, legislation and control of antimicrobial products in shrimp aquaculture and educate farmers on prudent antimicrobial use practices.",,"ABSTRACTABSTRACTAn approach is described to validate a fast and simple targeted screening method for antibiotic analysis in meat and aquaculture products by LC-MS/MS. The strategy of validation was applied for a panel of 75 antibiotics belonging to different families, i.e., penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, macrolides, quinolones and phenicols. The samples were extracted once with acetonitrile, concentrated by evaporation and injected into the LC-MS/MS system. The approach chosen for the validation was based on the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) guidelines for the validation of screening qualitative methods. The aim of the validation was to prove sufficient sensitivity of the method to detect all the targeted antibiotics at the level of interest, generally the maximum residue limit (MRL). A robustness study was also performed to test the influence of different factors. The validation showed that the method is valid to detect and identify 73 antibiotics of the 75 antibiotics studied in meat and aquaculture products at the validation levels.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validation approach for a fast and simple targeted screening method for 75 antibiotics in meat and aquaculture products using LC-MS/MS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, aquaculture production in the continent remains low despite significant investments in research and technology development. While numerous initiatives have been directed at technological innovation and transfer, their present scale of uptake is very slow and therefore inadequate to achieve transformational change envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. In this paper, we aim to (1) critically analyze the factors that influence fish farmer’s perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward technology adoption; and (2) to determine the impacts of technology adoption on farmer’s livelihoods. Primary data were collected using a self-administered digitized questionnaire to 331 randomly selected farmers in Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze data. Results revealed that variables including secondary education, diversified on-farm activities, farm size, production levels, attendance of extension training, ease of understanding, and ease of handling technologies were positive and significant predictors of aquaculture technology adoption. However, 30% of fish farmers were categorized as high adopters of novel aquaculture technologies, implying that there are gaps in technical skills hindering adoption of innovative technologies and best management practices. To facilitate learning and uptake of technologies and good practices by farmers, a range of aquaculture-related extension and communication materials, including posters, hard copy information leaflets and brochures of recipes in appropriate languages, short video presentations, and radio features, should be commissioned to support the smallholder farmers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Predicting uptake of aquaculture technologies among smallholder fish farmers in Kenya,,,,,,,,,,

However, potential sources and formation of hatchery bioaerosols are rarely characterized. In this study, bacterial multiplication on fresh shell fragments from turkey hatching eggs under conditions present in a hatcher incubator was investigated. A 105-fold amplification was observed both by colony count and total cell count gaining 4 × 107 cfu/cells per gram eggshell within 30 hr of incubation. Furthermore, the bacterial community present on eggshells was analyzed by generation of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and identification of eight isolates. RFLP analysis revealed no shift in community composition during incubation and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus gallinarum were found as the predominant species on turkey eggshells, both have been classified as risk group 2 microorganisms (German TRBA 466). Since Enterococcus spp. were found as predominant species on turkey eggshells, contribution of this genus to bioaerosol formation was demonstrated. During different work activities with poult and eggshell handling concentrations of airborne enterococci up to 1.3 × 104 cfu m−3 were detected. In contrast, no enterococci were identified at a day without poult or eggshell processing. In conclusion, turkey hatching eggs carry a viable specific microflora from breeder flocks to hatcheries. After hatching of turkey poults, hatcher incubators and eggshell fragments provide appropriate conditions for excessive bacterial growth. Thus, high bacterial loads on eggshell fragments are a source of potential harmful bioaersols caused by air flows, poult activity, and handling of equipment.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eggshells as a source for occupational exposure to airborne bacteria in hatcheries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Although aquaculture is the fastest growing food producing sector in the world and generates significant employment opportunities at multiple scales, men and women are not necessarily able to participate in aquaculture value chains in the same way, and benefits may not be evenly distributed between them. This paper aims to elucidate current knowledge of gendered engagement in and returns from aquaculture value chains. It does so by presenting a review of existing evidence on gender issues in aquaculture value chains along five key dimensions: gender division of labor, distribution of benefits, access and control over assets and resources, gender and social norms, power relations and governance. Subsequently, the potential results for value chain performance and potential upgrading pathways are presented. The review shows that there is limited high quality sex-disaggregated data regarding aquaculture value chains, in particular related to the distribution of benefits in the chain. It also shows that evidence is limited regarding other aspects of the quality of women's participation in and returns from these chains. Existing evidence, however, indicates gendered imbalances in all five dimensions assessed, with formal and informal barriers, including gender norms, limiting women's equal engagement and returns. The specifics were found to vary by context and to be shaped in relation to factors such as class, needs, and social and religious norms. The impact of gender inequity on value chain performance was also found to be an area of literature for which evidence is still limited. While the upgrading pathways as described in the literature may result in economic upgrading, they may have limited effect on improving inequity or social conditions in the chain, if they do not take underlying inequities in institutions into account. Together the evidence indicates the need for research to elucidate practical ways to increase women's engagement in and returns from aquaculture value chains through addressing formal and informal barriers to women's control over assets, including shifting underlying gender norms and relations towards gender equality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gender and aquaculture value chains: A review of key issues and implications for research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is argued that growth and mainstreaming of organic food production cannot be achieved solely by ethically aware consumers signalling their more sustainable purchase decision to the market. In fact, the intrinsic motivation of producers is an indispensable requisite for such a development. It is then the organic movement’s and the certifier’s (such as Naturland e.V.) task to bring together the values of consumers and producers. This challenge is explored in the following by using the example of organic aquaculture. Based on one of the author’s experience in the field of aquaculture certification since the late 1990s, in about twenty countries and with most aquaculture animal species, the paper examines critical value-based aspects that are prominent from the perspective of sustainability. These are: use of problematic substances in aquaculture production, stocking density, origin of feedstuff, certification procedure, and small-scale farming versus large aquaculture companies. On this basis, the paper describes and analyses attempts to formulate respective organic certification standards. In order to bring about organic aquaculture, it is argued that consumers’ choices alone are not sufficient and that successful transformation to sustainable aquaculture also needs to take into account values and preferences of producers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Certification Standards for Aquaculture Products: Bringing Together the Values of Producers and Consumers in Globalised Organic Food Markets,,,,,,,,,,

We sequenced two libraries consisting of different pools of individuals (n = 326 each) on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Consequently, over 99% target regions (3,178 SNPs) were amplified and 2,655 SNPs were available after filtering steps. Strong correlation was observed in the mean depth of coverage of each SNP between duplicate runs (r = 0.993). Genetic analysis using these genotype data successfully detected the known population structure and the sex determining locus of fugu.

"Abstract

Vibrio harveyi is a strategic human pathogen that occurs naturally in marine and estuarine environments. The pathogen is believed to cause acute septicemia, gastroenteritis, severe necrotizing soft-tissue infection, and high rate of lethality through ingestion of V. harveyi contaminated seafood. In this study, we isolated and characterized V. harveyi from water suspended sediment samples of black tiger shrimp ponds and from the sea coasts, in the east coast of the Bay of Bengal, India. Initial isolations of putative V. harveyi isolates were grown on thiosulfate-citrate-bill salts-sucrose agar (TCBS) plates for 36 h. Gram-negative and oxidase-positive colonies alone were selected and subsequently identified by 12 different conventional biochemical tests. The species specificity was confirmed by 16S rRNA, hemolysin and toxRvh genes were used through PCR targeted primers. Furthermore, genomic fingerprinting was carried out using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting, which showed that all the five V. harveyi were genetically distinct. From a total of 256 samples, a total of five strains of V. harveyi were isolated, of which three were from various shrimp ponds and two were from the coastal area. These five isolates were subjected to profiling against 15 antibiotics and the perusal results emphasized the V. harveyi resistance to ciprofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin, and vancomycin compared to other tested antibiotics. The present findings were helpful in understanding the multiple antibiotics resistance of V. harveyi, which indicates the urgent need for targeted alternative biocontrol strategies to enhance the prospects of commercially viable shrimp cultivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Molecular characterization of antibiotic resistant Vibrio harveyi isolated from shrimp aquaculture environment in the south east coast of India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology transfer and development is a key requirement for many research funders, yet there is a real paucity of scientifically documented evidence on how this transition is made and how it can be made more effective. The study described here details the experiences of an informal ‘community of practice’ working across research and commercialisation to set up and run a number of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems (innovative food systems addressing environmental impacts of traditional aquaculture) across Europe. Interviews were undertaken with seven European aquaculture companies across six countries (Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Norway and Scotland), each of which were involved with the IDREEM project (www.idreem.eu) which paired aquaculture businesses and research institutions in strategic partnerships to promote rapid implementation of IMTA. This study revealed three main shared experiences: the lack of an existing process for licensing IMTA sites and the temporal hold this put on obtaining a license; issues due to environmental constraints, including storms; and problems of drying and storing for those working with algae. Furthermore, three key lessons were learnt by those involved: the importance of choosing extractive IMTA species based on what is endemic to the area; identifying the correct system configuration may take a lot of trial and error, but simplicity is crucial; a key process was ‘learning by doing’ and a range of skills are required. We conclude that the development of a formal ‘community of practice’, a knowledge-sharing platform where all those engaging in IMTA can work together, would enable further unique insight and innovation in the process.

"Abstract

Ocean acidification may pose a major threat to commercial fisheries, especially those for calcifying shellfish species. This study was undertaken to estimate the potential economic costs resulting from ocean acidification on UK wild capture and aquaculture shellfish production. Applying the net present value (NPV) and partial equilibrium (PE) models, we estimate both direct and economy-wide economic losses of shellfish production by 2100. Estimates using the NPV method show that the direct potential losses due to reduced shellfish production range from 14% to 28% of fishery NPV. This equates to annual economic losses of between ö3 and ö6 billion of the UK’s GDP in 2013, for medium and high emission scenarios. Results using the PE model showed the total loss to the UK economy from shellfish production and consumption ranging from ö23–ö88 million. The results from both the direct valuation and predicted estimate for the economic losses on shellfish harvest indicate that there are regional variations due to different patterns of shellfish wild-capture and aquaculture, and the exploitation of species with differing sensitivities to ocean acidification. These results suggest that the potential economic losses vary depending on the chosen valuation method. This analysis is also partial as it did not include a wider group of species in early-life-stages or predator-prey effects. Nevertheless, findings show that the economic losses to the UK and its devolved administrations due to ocean acidification could be substantial. We conclude that addressing ocean acidification with the aim of preserving commercially valuable shellfish resources will require regional, national or international solutions using a combined approach to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions and shift in focus to exploit species that are less vulnerable to ocean acidification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The economic impacts of ocean acidification on shellfish fisheries and aquaculture in the United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Disinfection methods like chlorination are increasingly used to sanitize the water, equipment, tools and surfaces in aquaculture facilities. This is to improve water quality, and to maintain a hygienic environment for the well-being of aquatic organisms. However, chlorination can result in formation of regulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that can be carcinogenic and toxic. This study aims to evaluate if an optimal balance can be achieved between minimal regulated DBP formation and effective microbial inactivation with either chlorination or monochloramination for application in the Red Sea aquaculture waters. Upon chlorination, the concentration of total trihalomethanes (THMs), primarily bromoform, exceeded the regulatory limit of 80 μg/L even at the lowest tested concentration of chlorine (1 mg/L) and contact time (1 h). Comparatively, regulated THMs concentration was only detectable at 30 μg/L level in one of the three sets of monochloraminated marine aquaculture waters. The average log reduction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) by chlorine ranged from 2.3-log to 3.2-log with different contact time. The average log reduction of ARB by monochloramine was comparatively lower at 1.9 to 2.9-log. Although viable Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from monochloraminated samples as opposed to chlorinated samples, the abundance of S. aureus was not high enough to result in any significant microbial risks. Both chlorination and monochloramination did not provide any significant improvement in the reduction of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study demonstrates that a systematic evaluation is needed to determine the optimal disinfectant required to balance both microbial and chemical risks.

Fishes are a major protein food source for humans, with a high economic value in the aquaculture industry. Because endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have been introduced into aquatic ecosystems, the exposure of humans and animals that depend on aquatic foods, especially fishes, should be seriously considered. EDCs are emerging pollutants causing global concern because they can disrupt the endocrine system in aquatic organisms, mammals, and humans. These pollutants have been released into the environment through many sources, e.g., wastewater treatment plants, terrestrial run-off (industrial activities, pharmaceuticals, and household waste), and precipitation. The use of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and fertilizers for maintaining and increasing fish health and growth also contributes to EDC pollution in the water body. Human and animal exposure to EDCs occurs via ingestion of contaminated matrices, especially aquatic foodstuffs. This paper aims to review human EDC exposure via fish consumption. In respect to the trace concentration of EDCs in fish, types of instrument and clean-up method are of great concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Multi-class of endocrine disrupting compounds in aquaculture ecosystems and health impacts in exposed biota,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Healthy fish production requires intensive care and ensuring stable and healthy production environment inside the farm tank is a challenging task. An Internet of Things (IoT) based automated system is highly desirable that can continuously monitor the fish tanks with optimal resources utilization. Significant cost reduction can be achieved if farm equipment and water pumps are operated only when required using optimization schemes. In this paper, we present a general system design for smart fish farms. We have developed an optimization scheme for water pump control to maintain desired water level in fish tank with efficient energy consumption through appropriate selection of pumping flow rate and tank filling level. Proposed optimization scheme attempts to achieve a trade-off between pumping duration and flow rate through selection of optimized water level. Kalman filter algorithm is applied to remove error in sensor readings. We observed through simulation results that optimization scheme achieve significant reduction in energy consumption as compared to the two alternate schemes, i.e., pumping with maximum and minimum flow rates. Proposed system can help in collecting the data about the farm for long-term analysis and better decision making in future for efficient resource utilization and overall profit maximization.

"Abstract

The environmental effects of the copper aquaculture nets were estimated by a multidisciplinary approach. A copper alloy net (brass net) cage and a conventional net cage with Cu2O antifouling paint were established at a fish farm in Bathy Limani Bay, Paleros, Aetolia Acarnania region, Greece, for a 1-year period. Copper concentrations in abiotic (water, sediment, particulate matter) and biotic (organisms) samples were measured. The biological effects of copper on organisms (mussels, farmed fish) were further assessed with a battery of biochemical biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, metallothioneins). During the first 6 months of cage installations, the copper alloy (brass) net seemed to release more Cu to the surrounding environment and affect the biota more compared to the conventional net, although non-significant correlations were found between biotic and abiotic variables. However, at the end of the experimental period, equilibrium was reached in the copper alloy (brass) net cage with similar values of dissolved Cu and Cu in organisms as the conventional net cage. An exception to these results was the sampling of August 2013, where an increased effect on water chemistry and mussels in the conventional cage was observed, which may be attributed to the use of antifoulants on the examined conventional net or on the surrounding conventional nets. No accumulation of Cu in sediment was detected. No consistent temporal or spatial trend was observed for biochemical biomarkers. In addition, for both experimental cages and in all sampling periods, dissolved Cu never reached the maximum permissible limits in the Greek legislation, and Cu concentrations in the farmed fish and mussels do not exceed established limits for edible parts set by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

   Abstract
   
      The low rate of full‐time agricultural employment in China has tempted scholars to believe that capitalization does not necessarily lead to the trenchant effects of proletarianization. In this paper, I refute this hypothesis by showing agri‐capital's move from ‘formal subsumption’ to ‘real subsumption’ in shrimp aquaculture. Previously, due to natural and social barriers, capital had squeezed farmers' value by monopolizing the upstream and downstream sectors of the commodity chain. However, in recent years, after several disease outbreaks that have forced family farmers to abandon their business, agri‐capital has finally accomplished ‘real subsumption’ by penetrating into the farming process. Following the rise of a nascent shrimp production base in Leizhou, Guangdong Province, I explore how it accomplishes land transfer, technological control and labour supervision to outcompete family farms by capturing the high price of off‐season farming. This analysis helps us to understand the dynamics of class formation and the trajectory of proletarianization.

Peracetic acid (PAA) is an effective disinfectant/sanitizer for certain industrial applications. PAA has been described as a powerful oxidant capable of producing water quality benefits comparable to those expected with ozone application; however, the water oxidizing capacity of PAA in aquaculture systems and its effects on fish production require further investigation, particularly within recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS). To this end, a trial was conducted using six replicated RAS; three operated with semi-continuous PAA dosing and three without PAA addition, while culturing rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Three target PAA doses (0.05, 0.10, and 0.30 mg/L) were evaluated at approximately monthly intervals. A water recycle rate >99% was maintained and system hydraulic retention time averaged 2.7 days. Rainbow trout performance metrics including growth, survival, and feed conversion ratio were not affected by PAA dosing. Water quality was unaffected by PAA for most tested parameters. Oxidative reduction potential increased directly with PAA dose and was greater (P <  0.05) in RAS where PAA was added, indicating the potential for ORP to monitor PAA residuals. True color was lower (P <  0.05) in RAS with target PAA concentrations of 0.10 and 0.30 mg/L. Off-flavor (geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol) levels in culture water, biofilm, and trout fillets were not affected by PAA dosing under the conditions of this study. Overall, semi-continuous PAA dosing from 0.05-0.30 mg/L was compatible with rainbow trout performance and RAS operation, but did not create water quality improvements like those expected when applying low-dose ozone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evaluating the effects of prolonged peracetic acid dosing on water quality and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss performance in recirculation aquaculture systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         The rapid growth of the aquaculture industry to meet global seafood demand offers both risks and opportunities for resource management and conservation. In particular, hatcheries hold promise for stock enhancement and restoration, yet cultivation practices may lead to enhanced variation between populations at the expense of variation within populations, with uncertain implications for performance and resilience. To date, few studies have assessed how production techniques impact genetic diversity and population structure, as well as resultant trait variation in and performance of cultivated offspring. We collaborated with a commercial hatchery to produce multiple cohorts of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) from field‐collected broodstock using standard practices. We recorded key characteristics of the broodstock (male : female ratio, effective population size), quantified the genetic diversity of the resulting cohorts, and tested their trait variation and performance across multiple field sites and experimental conditions. Oyster cohorts produced under the same conditions in a single hatchery varied almost twofold in genetic diversity. In addition, cohort genetic diversity was a significant positive predictor of oyster performance traits, including initial size and survival in the field. Oyster cohorts produced in the hatchery had lower within‐cohort genetic variation and higher among‐cohort genetic structure than adults surveyed from the same source sites. These findings are consistent with “sweepstakes reproduction” in oysters, even when manually spawned. A readily measured characteristic of broodstock, the ratio of males to females, was positively correlated with within‐cohort genetic diversity of the resulting offspring. Thus, this metric may offer a tractable way both to meet short‐term production goals for seafood demand and to ensure the capacity of hatchery‐produced stock to achieve conservation objectives, such as the recovery of self‐sustaining wild populations.

Although regulators are assumed to work for the best interest of the people, they can have their own rational agendas; such as career advancement, self-aggrandizement and loyalty for a particular political ideology. We show that when officials are non-benevolent and agencies have unequal relative decision-making power, it is likely that a more powerful agency dictates policies in favor of its own agenda, even when such policies may not necessarily lead to optimal social welfare. In the case of aquaculture, higher relative power of a pro-environment agency leads to underdevelopment of the sector, as is the case in developed countries, whereas larger relative power of a pro-industry agency leads to higher growth, as is the case in developing countries.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Agency rivalry in a shared regulatory space and its impact on social welfare: The case of aquaculture regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Nonnative Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis were introduced throughout western North America in the early and mid 1900s, resulting in populations that are difficult to eradicate and that often threaten native salmonids. Male YY Brook Trout (MYY), created in the hatchery by feminizing XY males and then crossing them with normal XY males, comprise a novel approach to eradicating undesirable Brook Trout populations. If stocked MYY Brook Trout survive and reproduce with wild females, it could eventually drive the wild population sex ratio to 100% males, at which point the population would be unable to reproduce and would be eradicated after stocking ceased. In this study, we stocked the limited number of catchable‐size (mean TL = 229 mm) MYY hatchery Brook Trout available from an established MYY broodstock into four streams. In two streams, the wild Brook Trout population was suppressed via electrofishing prior to stocking to determine whether diminished competition with wild fish would increase the survival of hatchery MYY fish. We used genetic assignment testing to identify the successful reproduction of stocked MYY fish. Apparent survival of MYY Brook Trout averaged 18% in streams with wild population suppression (mean suppression, 17%) and 9% in streams without suppression, suggesting that suppression of the wild population before stocking increased MYY survival poststocking. Hatchery MYY Brook Trout comprised an estimated 3.1% of all adult Brook Trout during spawning. Genetic assignment tests identified successful reproduction of MYY fish in all streams in which they were stocked, with an average of 3.7% of fry being the progeny of MYY fish. Our results confirm that hatchery MYY fish stocked in streams can survive and spawn successfully with wild fish and produce all‐male progeny. Despite the slightly reduced fitness of MYY Brook Trout, this technology may be a viable method for eradicating undesirable nonnative Brook Trout populations.

"Abstract

Norway is the largest global producer and exporter of farmed salmon, however the growth of the industry has coincided with environmental impacts to the marine ecosystem and negative perceptions of salmon farming. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is one solution, and scientists in Norway have researched salmon-driven IMTA for over a decade. Their research suggests that IMTA can mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts of salmon farming through waste recycling, however regulations in Norway do not allow IMTA. A participatory workshop was conducted to assess the future of IMTA in Norway, and participants were experts with a comprehensive understanding of the biological and technological processes of IMTA or salmon farming. Two group exercises gave participants the opportunity to conceptualize IMTA in the Norwegian salmon industry, and results indicate that IMTA would improve perceptions of the industry, create skilled jobs in coastal communities, and provide the industry with new sustainable sources of marine ingredients for feed. Participants identified that advocates of IMTA have a difficult task in advancing their agenda because of other stakeholders, such as policymakers and the public concerned with the environmental impacts from salmon farming, communities that regulate access to their coastal zone, and a powerful industry focused on producing salmon. This article explores how advocates could advance IMTA regulations in Norway using agenda building to influence policymakers and agenda setting to sway public opinion. This is the first interdisciplinary article on IMTA in the Norwegian salmon industry using a social science approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conceptualizing future scenarios of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in the Norwegian salmon industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Abstract
         
            The California Central Valley contains the southernmost native populations of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, which inhabit a highly variable, anthropogenically altered environment. To mitigate habitat loss and support fisheries, millions of fall‐run hatchery salmon are released each year, often transported downstream to avoid in‐river mortality, with consequences not fully understood. We synthesize historical trends in release location and timing (1941–2017), focusing on outcomes influencing stock resilience, adult straying, and ocean arrival timing. Over time, juveniles have been transported increasing distances from the source hatchery, particularly during droughts. Transport distance was strongly associated with straying rate (averaging 0–9% vs. 7–89% for salmon released on site vs. in the bay upstream of Golden Gate Bridge, respectively), increasing the effects of hatchery releases on natural spawners. Decreasing variation in release location and timing could reduce spatiotemporal buffering, narrowing ocean arrival timings and increasing risk of mismatch with peak prey production. Central Valley salmon epitomize the pervasive challenge of balancing short‐term (e.g., abundance) against long‐term (e.g., stability) goals.

The concentrations, congener profiles and spatial distribution of 13 phthalate esters (PAEs) in the freshwater fish ponds in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region were investigated in water and sediment samples collect from 22 sites during Jul. 2016–Sept. 2017. The di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) was the predominant compounds in both water and sediment samples, accounting for 70.1% and 66.1% of ∑PAEs, respectively. The DEHP concentrations in the water samples collected from the sites of Zhongshan (35.7 μg/L), Jingmen (17.3 μg/L) and Nanhai (14.2 μg/L) were higher than that collected from other sampling sites (p < 0.05), and exceed the Chinese environmental quality standards for surface water (DEHP, 8.00 μg/L).

Integrated Agriculture Aquaculture (IAA) is characteristic with diversity of small-scale production systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam where most integrated aquaculture systems are closely associated to the VAC model, an ecosystem production that three components: garden (V), pond (A) and livestock pen (C) are integrated. These VAC systems effectively use all the available land, air, water and solar energy resources, and also effectively recycle by-products and waste for providing diversified agricultural products to meet the complex nutritional demands of rural communities. The IAA systems are dynamic, diverse and subject to economic and environmental changes. By investigating 167 aquaculture households, the traditional VAC, New VAC, Animal Fish (AF) and Commercial Fish (FS) systems are identified as four existing IAA systems. This paper presents the main characteristics and economic efficiency of these IAA systems. The study’s results indicate clear evidence that the traditional VAC system and New VAC system are the most efficient and effective models. The findings of this study have shed light on the important role of integrated aquaculture systems to food security and economic development of households and local communities. The VAC systems are likely to propose for improving household food security and developing the local economy.

"Abstract

Using the contingent behavior method, we estimate the benefits derived from the biomitigative effects of Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) in the farming of Atlantic salmon. We asked a sample of Canadians how their farmed Atlantic salmon consumption choices would be affected by the availability of IMTA products in response to the decreased external costs they would impose on the surrounding marine environment. We used a random-effects negative binomial model to estimate their different demand functions and, from them, measures of increases in consumer surplus arising from the availability of IMTA products. We estimated a lower bound for the aggregate benefit that current salmon consumers in Canada would derive from the introduction of IMTA salmon of about CAD 280 million/year, while less restrictive assumptions about the representativeness of our sample would lead to an aggregate figure of about CAD 1.5 billion/year. We also found that consumers would benefit from proper labeling of farmed salmon, since conventionally farmed salmon and IMTA salmon are considered non-substitutes, the latter being a normal good and the former an inferior good for the typical consumer. We find that there is room for improving welfare by disseminating information to enhance consumer understanding of IMTA production techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Estimating the biomitigation benefits of Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture: A contingent behavior analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Lake aquaculture in China has become more common, but there has been only limited research on its effects on the quality of lake water. We measured selected water quality parameters from July to September 2015 in 23 lakes in the middle reach of the Yangtze River basin to investigate the effects of different types of lake aquaculture on water quality. The lakes were classified as “low,” “medium,” “high,” or “fallow” based on their stocking rate. The results showed that turbidity, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, conductivity, chloride, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, and chlorophyll a were lowest in the low lakes and highest in the high or medium lakes (and on occasion in the fallow lakes). These results confirm a close relationship between the level of fish stocking and many of the water quality parameters measured and that the effects of banning aquaculture in the fallow lakes has likely not yet been fully realized.

Aquaculture, the production of farm-raised fish, is a major industry that employs and feeds millions of individuals across the globe, but which may also be a nexus of emerging public health threats. This study examined potential health risks associated with integrated aquaculture operations by with One Health approach using a suite of tools to study water contamination sources, pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and bacterial community in the water from fishponds. Water samples from 27 fishponds across 9 villages were collected in Jiangmen City, China. Microbial source tracking, pathogens (including Salmonella and Arcobacter), toxin-producing Microcystis, and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) resistant to tetracycline, sulfonamide, and carbapenem were quantified with qPCR. Bacterial community was determined with next-generation sequencing. All ponds exceeded E. coli single-day maximum criteria of US, and 67% ponds exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) waste-fed aquaculture guidelines for protecting consumers and pond workers, representing a high degree of fecal contamination and potential pathogen risks in these ponds. The majority of the ponds were positive for human- (84%) and pig- (41%) associated fecal contamination. Salmonella and microcystin-producing Microcystis were detected in 37% and 15% of the ponds, respectively, while Arcobacter was not detected in any ponds. ARB were highly prevalent. Among the measured factors, canonical correspondence analysis and network analysis demonstrated that secchi depth, temperature and conductivity were the major environmental elements impacting the bacterial community structure, while Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the major biological factor. This study demonstrated the presence of intersecting health risk factors in aquaculture facilities and can lay the foundation for addressing these risks in aquaculture management in rural China, with potential applicability in other developing regions dependent on aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The microbiome and antibiotic resistance in integrated fishfarm water: Implications of environmental public health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         A feeding trial was conducted to determine the maximum substitution limits of poultry by‐product meal (PBM; 66% crude protein) protein for fish meal (FM; 59% crude protein) protein in the diet of juvenile Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata (family Serranidae). Eight isonitrogenous (44% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) diets were formulated to replace FM protein with PBM protein at 0 (control), 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% in Black Sea Bass diets. Diets were fed twice daily to triplicate groups of juveniles (initial mean weight = 1.2 g) to apparent satiation for 8 weeks in a recirculating aquaculture system. Final survival was excellent (95–100%) in all diet treatments, with no significant differences. No significant differences in body weight gain (BWG) were observed in fish fed the 40–90% PBM protein diets (1,136–1,357%) compared with the control diet (1,307%). However, BWG of fish fed the 100% PBM protein diet (1,045%) was significantly lower than in the control group. Regression analysis with BWG indicated that PBM protein can replace FM protein in Black Sea Bass diets at levels as high as 81.8%, with no reduction in fish growth performance. For fish fed diets with up to 90% PBM protein, feed conversion (1.08–1.17) and protein efficiency ratios (2.01–2.14) were not significantly different from fish fed a control 100% FM‐protein‐based diet (0.99 and 2.29, respectively). Apparent digestibility coefficients of dietary protein remained high (81.6–87.0%) under all levels of FM replacement with PBM protein. After the feeding trial, whole body and muscle protein content and the concentrations of whole body n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids showed no significant differences among the treatments at FM protein replacement levels up to 90%. Poultry by‐product meal is a promising alternative protein source for sustainable diet development in Black Sea Bass.

"Abstract

With the rapid growth of aquaculture, some negative factors of extensive monoculture accumulated, causing integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) to draw increasing attention worldwide for its ecological and economic advantages. However, the development of IMTA in open water systems may not go as smoothly as anticipated—at least in Weihai, China, some producers who have adopted it would prefer to return to monoculture. This paper explores the problem from the angle of the economic performance by providing an in-depth analysis of costs and revenues generated by kelp monoculture and kelp-mollusk polyculture (IMTA). We find that the monoculture generates higher profits during the same production cycle. Besides inherent defects in system design, the rapidly growing labor cost and depressing selling price of the mollusk conspire to aggravate the economic failure of IMTA. Due to positive environmental externalities, the social benefits associated with IMTA are higher than the private benefits. This implies that there is a role for the government to generalize IMTA to achieve more total benefits. But single policy such as subsidies may backfire, a combination of policies designed to promote IMTA could be effective.

Efforts to expand marine aquaculture into offshore environments have increased in the United States, however many questions remain about whether offshore aquaculture is a feasible and appropriate activity. This paper explores these questions by investigating stakeholder perceptions of offshore mussel aquaculture in New England, USA. These views provide insight into the important challenges and opportunities facing expansion, and elucidate whether and how industry may develop and be incorporated into ocean planning and management. Results shows that regulatory and financial conditions are considered the primary challenges facing offshore expansion, whereas technical, environmental, and market conditions were generally deemed favorable or manageable. There is greater uncertainty about social and political conditions. While moving mussel aquaculture offshore lessens the conflicts associated with inshore activity, it also moves industry into new spaces with unfamiliar users. There are tensions inherent in addressing these challenges. Whereas broad regulatory change will encourage offshore development, targeted government involvement may be more productive in the near term. Similarly, while large seafood companies may appear viable candidates for offshore development, they are also limited by regulatory, social, and political resistance. Overall, an increased emphasis on government interventions at the local and regional scale are desirable for proponents of offshore expansion. The paper discusses the management implications of these findings, and suggests that a shift in focus toward targeted and non-regulatory government interventions; local, regional, and informal planning discussions; and community-based and cooperative mussel aquaculture initiatives may hold promise for responsible development in New England offshore waters and elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Moving mussels offshore?

"Abstract

The efficiency of oyster-shell waste for the removal of phosphorous (P) in saltwater was herein evaluated. For that, different factors were tested, being attained > 56% and > 98% P removal by natural oyster shell (NOS)-fraction < 0.125 mm and COS (calcined oyster shell)-fraction 0.5 mm, respectively. Adsorption was the main mechanism suggested for NOS, whilst a co-mechanism of precipitation occurred with COS. NOS adsorption was consistent with Langmuir model and followed both the Elovich and Intraparticle Difusion kinetic models. COS followed only Pseudo-Second Order and, mainly, the Elovich model. Overall, optimal conditions for P removal from saltwater were established for NOS and COS, which will unquestionably allow to comply with regulated P levels for the discharge of wastewater from saltwater RAS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First study on oyster-shell-based phosphorous removal in saltwater — A proxy to effluent bioremediation of marine aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Culture of shrimp, mainly Penaeus monodon, makes an important contribution to Bangladesh's aquaculture industry. Shrimp hatcheries are the foundation on which the shrimp industry is built. Hatchery performance and management therefore has extremely important implications for the long‐term viability of the entire shrimp sector, especially given its vulnerability to diseases such as white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). This article provides a review of the history of shrimp hatchery development in Bangladesh and an overview of the current status of the shrimp hatchery sector and the challenges it faces. This article also provides a unique historical analysis of shrimp broodstock performance and rates of WSSV infection using data collected from hatcheries between 2007 and 2013. This reveals sharp declines in broodstock quality and performance over time, and high rates of WSSV infection, with potential major implications for the future sustainability of the sector.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coastal protection, nutrient cycling, erosion control, water purification, and carbon sequestration are ecosystem services provided by salt marshes. Additionally, salt ponds offer coastal breeding and a nursery habitat for fishes and they provide abundant invertebrates, such as amphipods, which are potentially useful as a resource in aquaculture. Fishmeal and fish oil are necessary food resources to support aquaculture of carnivorous species due to their omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA). Currently, aquaculture depends on limited fisheries and feed with elevated n-3 LC-PUFA levels, but the development of more sustainable food sources is necessary. Amphipods appear to be a potential high quality alternative feed resource for aquaculture. Hence, a nutritional study was carried out for several main amphipod species—Microdeutopus gryllotalpa, Monocorophium acherusicum, Gammarus insensibilis, Melita palmata and Cymadusa filosa—in terrestrial ponds in the South of Spain. These species showed high protein content (up to 40%), high n-3 PUFA and phospholipid levels, and high levels of phophatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and triacylglycerols (TAG), the latter being significantly high for  M. acherusicum.  M. gryllotalpa and M. acherusicum showed the highest proportion of lipids (19.15% and 18.35%, respectively). Isoleucine, glycine and alanine were the dominant amino acids in all species. In addition, amphipods collected from ponds showed low levels of heavy metals. Furthermore, the biochemical profiles of the five species of amphipods have been compared with other studied alternative prey. Therefore, pond amphipods are good candidates to be used as feed, and are proposed as a new sustainable economic resource to be used in aquaculture. G. insensibilis may be the best for intensive culture as an alternative feed resource because it shows: (1) adequate n-3 PUFA and PL composition; (2) high levels of glycine, alanine, tyrosine, isoleucine and lysine; (3) high natural densities; (4) large body size (≥1 cm), and (5) high concentration of calcium. Moreover, a combined culture of amphipods and fishes in these marsh ponds seems a promising and environmentally sustainable way to develop Integrate Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) in these ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Crustacean amphipods from marsh ponds: a nutritious feed resource with potential for application in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture
"Abstract

The use of aquaculture is increasing to meet the growing global demand for seafood. However, the use of aquaculture for seafood production incurs potential human health risks, especially from enteric bacteria such as Salmonella spp. Salmonella spp. was the most frequently reported cause of outbreaks associated with crustaceans from 1998 to 2004. Among crustacean species, shrimp are the most economically important, internationally traded seafood commodity, and the most commonly aquaculture-raised seafood imported to the United States. To inform safe aquaculture practices, a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was performed, incorporating stochastic variability in pathogen growth, industrial shrimp processing, and consumer shrimp preparation. Several scenarios including gamma irradiation and cooking time were considered in order to examine the relative importance of these practices in terms of their impact on risk. Median annual infection risks for all scenarios considered were below 10−4 and median disability adjusted life year (DALY) metrics were below 10−6 DALY per person per year, however, 95th percentile risks were above 10−4 annual probability of infection and 10−6 DALY per person per year for scenarios with improper cooking and lack of gamma irradiation. The greatest difference between microbiological risks for the scenarios tested was observed when comparing proper vs. improper cooking (5–6 orders of magnitude) and gamma irradiation (4–5 orders of magnitude) compared to (up to less than 1 order of magnitude) for peeling and “deveining” (removing the shrimp digestive tract) vs. peeling only. The findings from this research suggest that restriction of Salmonella spp. to low levels (median 5–30 per L aquaculture pond water) may be necessary for scenarios in which proper downstream food handling and processing cannot be guaranteed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Salmonella risks due to consumption of aquaculture-produced shrimp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Agencies have a growing range of options for risk assessment of nonnative species varying from comprehensive assessments to rapid risk screens. Risk screens identify high‐risk and low‐risk species and those where more evaluation is warranted. Despite development and testing of risk‐screening methods, there is little information in the literature regarding their implementation in management decisions. We used a screening tool, the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK), coupled with a detailed literature review to evaluate the risks of the genus Arapaima across Florida, where there is growing interest in its culture as a food fish. We found a medium risk of invasiveness overall, the greatest risk being to subtropical south Florida due to the low cold tolerance of Arapaima that it would experience further north. Ultimately the agency determined that a combination of literature review and the risk screen was sufficient to inform their decision making and that current conditional species regulations provided adequate risk mitigation to allow culture. The agency saved time and money by developing background information and a preliminary estimate of risk prior to engaging in comprehensive assessment. Flexibility allows agencies to tailor their risk assessment and management processes to different risk environments and to better inform decision making.

Therefore, the integration of genetic information into fisheries and aquaculture management is becoming crucial to ensure species’ long-term persistence. The raising commercial value of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) and its roe represents a growing challenge to the sustainable management of this economically important fishery resource. Here, microsatellites were used to investigate patterns of genetic variation in a Mediterranean area that harbor flourishing fisheries and practice semi-intensive farming of grey mullet. Genetic diversity within populations is smaller than values reported in previous studies as a result of the lower polymorphism displayed by the new microsatellite loci. Lack of genetic structuring points to the existence of a unique genetic stock, which is consistent with the species’ high dispersal capabilities. Nonetheless, differences in local population effective size as well as the excess of related individuals do not completely fit the picture of a large panmictic population. Baseline genetic information here gathered will allow to set up the genetic monitoring of regional fish stocks, which is needed to assess the impact of both harvesting and aquaculture on the genetic integrity of Mugil cephalus wild populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic patterns in Mugil cephalus and implications for fisheries and aquaculture management,,,,,,,,,,

Research was carried out to determine the effectiveness of 4 hatching eggs disinfection processes (i.e., disinfecting products and administration method) using a multi-pronged approach assessing the reduction of microbial eggshell contamination, the effects on worker exposure, hatching results and broiler performance, and, finally, suitability for use in commercial hatcheries. The 4 disinfection processes were: sodium dichlorocyanurate (DC) by thermonebulization, hydrogen peroxide 6% by nebulization (HP6), electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW) by fogging, and hydrogen peroxide 30% vapor (HP30). In order to meet commercial hatchery conditions, the tested products were applied in an experimental hatchery by aerial disinfection in a dedicated room, not sprayed directly onto the eggs. Compared to the untreated control group, eggshell microbial load was significantly decreased by over 1 log10 cfu per egg in groups DC and HP30. These results were confirmed during a second experiment. In addition, these 2 products comply with legal requirements on worker exposure. Fertility and hatching results were significantly higher in group HP30 than in group DC, with no impact on chick quality and subsequent broiler performance. Under these study conditions, the disinfection process (i.e., administration of the product, contact with the eggs and aeration) lasted 65 min in group DC vs. 135 min in group HP30. When considering commercial hatchery conditions, this difference in application time confers a clear advantage on the DC process. Moreover, the investment required for HP30 is much higher than for DC. Overall, HP30 presented a clear advantage for hatching results whereas DC is a relatively more practical and less expensive disinfection process. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor as an egg disinfection process.

   Abstract
   
      
      Tropical ornamental aquaculture is dominated by the production of nonnative species and is an important industry in Florida. However, the escape of nonnative species can pose challenges to the industry and also natural resource managers. Escapement of nonnative species and their potential impacts has led to suggestions that ornamental aquaculture is unregulated and lacks transparency. Comprehensive regulation of Florida aquaculture began in 1999 with the creation of the Division of Aquaculture (Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services; FDACS) along with aquaculture best management practices (BMPs). Although FDACS regulates commercial aquaculture through application of BMPs, which includes provisions for escapement of nonnative species, the implementation of aquaculture BMPs has been largely unverified. Our objective was to examine how aquaculture BMPs have been implemented to prevent the escape of nonnative species, how facilities are inspected, and the rates and causes of noncompliance. Site visits were conducted alongside FDACS inspectors on two occasions at 23 aquaculture facilities. Historical compliance records dating back to 1999 were also acquired. All facilities implemented BMPs to address escapement, which was shown by operational practices and infrastructure. The FDACS inspectors routinely enforced aquaculture BMPs, especially in areas of effluent control. When noncompliance issues were noted (57% of facilities in 2013; 39% in 2014), they were often minor (48% of issues) and quickly remedied by producers. Noncompliance with BMPs varied among facilities and was more often related to the release of sediment than nonnative species escapement. Noncompliance was also related to the size of the facility (number of ponds and greenhouses) and the presence of a detention pond. Because of its transparency, regulation of Florida aquaculture might provide a model for the development, implementation, and verification of aquaculture BMPs.

"Abstract

Scholars taking the evolutionary perspective argue that technologies, competence and institutions of successful paths may spill over to related industry initiatives and subsequent industry paths. The notion of co-evolution has been introduced as an analytical category for such interconnectivity. In this article, we investigate the development of salmon farming in Norway as a successful industry path and its linkages with cod farming, a subsequent emerging industry path. In the public debate, there has been an expectation that knowledge and solutions from salmon farming will diffuse to aquaculture for other species. However, this diffusion appears to be missing. Cod farming is an area that should capitalize on the success of salmon aquaculture, and we investigate why cod farmers appear to be unable to utilize the experience and knowledge of salmon farmers and copy their solutions. We found that the development of a specialized institutional arrangement for salmon farming makes these models incompatible with the needs of farming of other species, resulting in limited co-evolution between subsequent aquaculture industry paths. Thus, a situation characterized by strong co-evolution within an industry path, facilitating the development of an institutional arrangement tailor-made for the firms of the industry, reduce the possibilities for co-evolution between related industry paths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Path dependency, institutionalization and co-evolution: The missing diffusion of the blue revolution in Norwegian aquaculture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the recovery strategies entails the release of adults for volitional spawning in Redfish Lake, Idaho, for rebuilding of the natural population. In this paper, we describe the productivity metrics from this strategy. We evaluated eight spawn years to address three primary questions: (1) What metrics for eggs to smolts, smolts per female, and smolt‐to‐adult returns (SARs) result from recent adult releases? (2) How do these metrics compare with historical estimates for Redfish Lake and estimates for other Sockeye Salmon populations throughout the range? and (3) Does the current combination of smolts per female and SARs result in population replacement? Replacement was determined as two adult recruits per female assuming an even sex ratio. We found that the reintroduced adults, despite being derived from a multigenerational captive broodstock, were able to successfully spawn and produce offspring that migrated to the ocean and returned as adults. Smolt abundance, size, and age data suggest that the population is functioning below density dependence. However, increased smolt production did not translate into greater adult returns and this is likely due to out‐of‐basin factors. Productivity metrics were similar to those of the wild population in Redfish Lake during the 1950s and 1960s. However, both current and historic productivity estimates were near the low end of the range for other Sockeye Salmon populations and have not resulted in population replacement. Until freshwater and out‐of‐basin survival can be improved, our data suggest that adult releases will continue to be an important recovery strategy to prevent cohort collapse and to rebuild naturally spawning populations.

         In operations research, there are methodological tools included in decision theory that can help decision‐makers understand and systematize the decision‐making process. Decisions can be classified either as mono‐criterial, when only one criterion or goal is considered to evaluate its performance or multicriterial, which takes into account the interaction between two or more goals or criteria that can be in conflict. Natural resource management and finance are some important examples where the implementation of this type of tools has benefited the decision‐making process because they allow a number of criteria or objectives to be weighted in a transparent manner to assist when one or more decision‐makers are involved. Despite this, its application was not common in aquaculture; however, in recent years, efforts have increased exponentially. This work seeks to identify opportunity areas for development of new aquaculture‐related research through the implementation of multicriterial decision‐making methods (MCDM). To achieve this, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis was performed to detect MCDM applications that have been implemented in aquaculture industry (24 documents that were grouped into eight applications). Later, this information was complemented through the analysis of selected applications in natural resources management, specifically in fisheries, animal husbandry and agriculture. We propose 23 research topics relevant to the aquaculture industry that can be addressed by the methodologies in MCDM.

While this trend is observed in a wide array of policy domains, it is particularly common in the regulation of natural resource-based industries which requires the simultaneous consideration of an interrelated set of economic, technical, and social factors. In this article, we examine outcomes associated with collaborative policymaking groups involved in informing state aquaculture policy, referred to herein as aquaculture partnerships. We define outcomes here as consequences on relevant contextual conditions (social, political, and environmental) that follow from the work or design of collaborative processes. Using data collected through an online survey of partnership participants (n = 123), we examine individual and procedural factors that significantly associate with partnerships’ positive or negative influence on a set of policy and social outcomes, as perceived by their participants. Overall, we find that participants’ ability to mobilize scientific and technical resources to achieve group objectives, perceptions of procedural fairness, and individual-level learning are all positively associated with partnership influence on policy and/or social outcomes.

"Abstract

Lack of quality seed and technical knowhow are considered major constraints to improving aquaculture productivity and profitability in Bangladesh. This paper assesses the outcomes of investments in improving carp seed quality and farmer training, targeting poor and women fish farmers, on the productivity and profitability of homestead aquaculture systems in Southwest Bangladesh. The paper also assesses the effect of factors such as stocking density, use of fertilizer and feed, farmers’ characteristics and location on fish yields and determines the major driving factors influencing adoption of improved practices. The results show that farmers who used improved carp seed and received training had higher yield and profit from homestead aquaculture than farmers who received training but did not use improved seed. Both of these farmer categories had higher homestead pond yields and profit than those who did not receive training but used improved seed and all three categories were found to have higher yield and profit than the control group. These results suggest that using improved seed without technical advice is unlikely to have a significant impact on aquaculture productivity and profitability while training without using improved quality seed is likely to have a positive impact on these outcomes. These results are supported by a multiple regression model which shows that, when controlling for other factors, farmers who had been trained and used improved seed were 52% more productive than the control group, while those who had been trained and did not use improved seed were 15% more productive. There was no significant difference (P < 0.05) in productivity between farmers who had not received training but used improved quality seed and the control group. Location, stocking density, pond water area and experience were also found to significantly influence homestead pond productivity. The additional net return generated by farmers as a result of investments in improved seed and training is estimated to be approximately US$ 470,000 and US$ 210,000 for training alone, representing a return on investment (ROI) of 285% and 394% respectively. Despite the high ROI, the modest absolute increases in income and production estimated for participating households, due mostly to the low base from which growth is taking place, suggests the need for future investments to bring about relatively higher rates of productivity increases if they are to have meaningful impacts on household production and income. Overall, these results suggest that it is not enough for aquaculture development interventions to focus only on the technical fix of improved seed, rather capacity building of farmers is also crucial if aquaculture productivity and profitability are to be successfully improved.

      Since formalin is widely used in prevention of Saprolegnia infections in salmonid fish hatcheries, there is a need for more environmentally safe treatment methods. Therefore, we screened 360 bacterial isolates against their ability to antagonize the growth of Saprolegnia parasitica hyphae in vitro, and best strains were selected according to their antagonistic properties and colonization capability on rainbow trout egg surface. Protective bacterial cultures of Pseudomonas sp. M162, Pseudomonas sp. M174 and Janthinobacterium M169 were tested for prevention of Saprolegnia sp. infections during incubation trials of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs with UV irradiated (400 mWs cm−2) and non‐treated inlet water. UV irradiation of inlet water significantly decreased mortality during the incubation. Lowest mortalities were observed in protective culture treated groups incubated with UV‐irradiated inlet water. UV irradiation increased the dominance of the main bacterial colonizers and variation in the bacterial species diversity between the experimental units.

      For salmon populations in the Columbia River and Snake River basins, many of which are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, reliable estimates of the proportion of hatchery‐origin adults in spawning areas (p) are needed to assess population status and the genetic and demographic interactions of hatchery‐ and natural‐origin fish. Some hatchery fish receive visible marks, coded wire tags (CWTs), parentage‐based tags (PBTs), or all three. This allows one to identify whether fish recovered after release are of hatchery origin. Parentage‐based tagging involves genotyping hatchery broodstock and uses parentage assignments as “tags” that identify the origin and brood year of their progeny. We derived a maximum likelihood estimator of p and applied it to the 2012 and 2013 carcass survey data for spring–summer Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the South Fork Salmon River, Idaho. Maximum likelihood estimation was also applied to CWT data and, for investigating the importance of expected tag recoveries on precision, to simulated PBT data for fall Chinook Salmon spawning in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River. Precision of p from maximum likelihood estimation increased with the expected number of tag recoveries in a carcass survey, whether CWTs or PBTs. In the South Fork Salmon River application, there were 340% more PBT recoveries than CWT recoveries, leading to greater precision in release‐specific values of p from maximum likelihood estimation. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure provides fisheries managers a method to design a tagging and sampling program aimed at estimating p, a valuable measure of the potential for interaction of wild‐ and hatchery‐origin fish on the spawning grounds. To design a program for estimating p, we recommend selecting a target level of precision and then choosing a tagging fraction and sampling rate that delivers that precision in the most cost‐effective way.

The aim of the paper is to highlight the two faces of shrimp aquaculture as a wicked driver, emphasizing its potential role in activating systematic conversion of lagoon –based fisheries commons to non-commons and vice versa. We use the cases of aquaculture-led privatisation in Chilika Lagoon, located in the Bay of Bengal area of India, and collective action surrounding shrimp aquaculture in Northwestern Sri Lanka. For both studies, data are collected through mixed research methods, including semi-directive interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations. Our analysis shows clear evidence that shrimp aquaculture can potentially contribute to either making commons or losing commons depending on the context and influences of multi-level drivers. Aquaculture-led factors contributing to the process of losing commons in Chilika are: large-scale, individually owned aquaculture operations; encroachment of customary fishery commons; loss of commons rights (access and entitlements); breakdown of commons institutions; policy changes; caste politics and resource conflicts; ecological disturbances; change in fishing practices. In Sri Lanka, aquaculture related factors contributing to making commons are: coordinating discharge; built-in incentive for stewardship; multi-level commons institutions; collective decision-making; bottom-up management approach; mixed commons regime; and small-scale operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Two faces of shrimp aquaculture: commonising vs. decommonising effects of a wicked driver,,,,,,,,,,

The waste of fish food has always been a serious problem in aquaculture. On one hand, the leftover fish food spawns a big economic loss in the industry because feedstuff accounts for a large proportion of the investment. On the other hand, the left over fish food may pollute the water and worsen the living environment of aquatic products. In this paper, we develop an adaptive thresholding method for detecting uneaten fish food in underwater images. To deal with non-uniform illumination in underwater environments, we focus on analyzing the local histogram of intensities in a mask for each pixel. The Expectation-maximization-guided Gaussian mixture is used to fit the histogram to figure out its type, and then an adaptive threshold is computed accordingly. At last the central pixel of the mask is compared with the threshold to generate the binary detection result. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains desirable detection of leftover fish food in many underwater environments with different water turbidity levels and with different extent of unevenness of illumination. In the four test underwater environments, the lowest True Positive Rate of the proposed method is higher than 80%, and the highest rate reaches 95.9%. The False Positive Rates of the proposed method are no higher than 2.7%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Detection of uneaten fish food pellets in underwater images for aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Evaluating the contribution of wild and hatchery fish to a fishery is essential to understand economic feasibility as well as the impact of hatchery fish on the ecosystem. However, a precise estimate of this contribution is often difficult to obtain, particularly when hatchery and wild fish are mixed in the catch. In this study, we quantified the contribution of hatchery and wild Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha to the mixed‐stock commercial fishery in Japan by identifying the ratio of otolith‐marked hatchery fish to unmarked and presumably wild fish. The contribution of hatchery fish to the total coastal catch of Pink Salmon in Japan was estimated to be 16.6% and 26.4% in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Thus, the majority of the commercial salmon catch originated from naturally spawned wild fish. Economic yield per release by Japanese hatcheries was 2.2 yen (¥2.2) (≈US$0.022) and ¥1.5 in 2011 and 2012.

","ABSTRACTABSTRACTIntegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is the farming, in proximity, of aquaculture species from different trophic levels and with complementary ecosystem functions. IMTA allows one species’ uneaten feed and wastes, nutrients, and by-products to be recaptured and converted into fertilizer, feed, and energy for the other crops. By taking advantage of synergistic interactions between species, IMTA can help aquaculture evolve towards more responsible and sustainable systems. This study uses data from a contingent valuation survey to provide an estimation of the non-use benefits that, in the form of biomitigation of the external costs imposed on the marine environment, would be derived by Canadians from the adoption of IMTA for Atlantic salmon aquaculture. We find the benefits accruing to households who do not purchase salmon habitually would range between about $43 million/year and about $65 million/year for the next five years, depending on the treatment of ‘don’t know’ responses to the payment question.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A contingent valuation of the biomitigation benefits of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"ABSTRACTABSTRACTShellfish aquaculture can result in conflicts among stakeholders who perceive impacts and tradeoffs regarding sense of place, aesthetic, recreational, economic, and ecological values. Pacific geoduck clams (Panopea generosa Gould 1850) are grown in intertidal plots using gear- and labor-intensive techniques that result in a high value export product. A confluence of issues has resulted in on-going social and legal tensions surrounding geoduck aquaculture in southern Puget Sound, Washington (WA), USA. Using interviews and document analysis, we explored stakeholder perspectives and policy issues related to geoduck aquaculture in southern Puget Sound. Twenty-three stakeholders were interviewed, including state agency employees, representatives of the aquaculture industry, nongovernmental organizations, landowners, a tribal member, and an academic. Nine state hearings board decisions on challenges to aquaculture permits were also analyzed. Stakeholders articulated a variety of perspectives regarding aesthetic, recreational, land-use, ecological, political, regulatory, and economic aspects of geoduck aquaculture activities. Hearings board cases addressed similar issues (aesthetic, ecological, and recreational), as well as challenges to restrictions on aquaculture. Potential strategies for managing this conflict include emphasizing best management practices, identifying and incorporating best available science, joint fact-finding approaches, and initiating and improving communication among all stakeholders.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Digging Deep: Managing Social and Policy Dimensions of Geoduck Aquaculture Conflict in Puget Sound, Washington",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the most valuable aquaculture fish in Europe is the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, but the profitability of trout production is threatened by a highly lethal infectious disease, viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), caused by the VHS virus (VHSV). For the past few decades, the subgenogroup Ia of VHSV has been the main cause of VHS outbreaks in European freshwater-farmed rainbow trout. Little is currently known, however, about the phylogenetic radiation of this Ia lineage into subordinate Ia clades and their subsequent geographical spread routes. We investigated this topic using the largest Ia-isolate dataset ever compiled, comprising 651 complete G gene sequences: 209 GenBank Ia isolates and 442 Ia isolates from this study. The sequences come from 11 European countries and cover the period 1971–2015. Based on this dataset, we documented the extensive spread of the Ia population and the strong mixing of Ia isolates, assumed to be the result of the Europe-wide trout trade. For example, the Ia lineage underwent a radiation into nine Ia clades, most of which are difficult to allocate to a specific geographic distribution. Furthermore, we found indications for two rapid, large-scale population growth events, and identified three polytomies among the Ia clades, both of which possibly indicate a rapid radiation. However, only about 4% of Ia haplotypes (out of 398) occur in more than one European country. This apparently conflicting finding regarding the Europe-wide spread and mixing of Ia isolates can be explained by the high mutation rate of VHSV. Accordingly, the mean period of occurrence of a single Ia haplotype was less than a full year, and we found a substitution rate of up to 7.813 × 10−4 nucleotides per site per year. Finally, we documented significant differences between Germany and Denmark regarding their VHS epidemiology, apparently due to those countries’ individual handling of VHS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Phylogeny of the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus in European Aquaculture,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,"In salmonids, the release of hatchery-reared fish has been shown to cause irreversible genetic impacts on wild populations. However, although responsible practices for producing and releasing genetically diverse, hatchery-reared juveniles have been published widely, they are rarely implemented. Here, we investigated genetic differences between wild and early-generation hatchery-reared populations of the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (a commercially important species in Europe) to assess whether hatcheries were able to maintain natural levels of genetic diversity. To test the hypothesis that hatchery rearing would cause bottleneck effects (that is, a substantial reduction in genetic diversity and differentiation from wild populations), we compared the levels and patterns of genetic variation between two hatcheries and four nearby wild populations, using samples from both Spain and Ireland. We found that hatchery-reared populations were less diverse and had diverged significantly from the wild populations, with a very small effective population size and a high degree of relatedness between individuals. These results raise a number of concerns about the genetic impacts of their release into wild populations, particularly when such a degree of differentiation can occur in a single generation of hatchery rearing. Consequently, we suggest that caution should be taken when using hatchery-reared individuals to augment fisheries, even for marine species with high dispersal capacity, and we provide some recommendations to improve hatchery rearing and release practices. Our results further highlight the need to consider the genetic risks of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles into the wild during the establishment of restocking, stock enhancement and sea ranching programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do hatchery-reared sea urchins pose a threat to genetic diversity in wild populations?,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Job categories shape the contexts that contribute to worker well-being, including their health, connectivity, and engagement. Using data from the 2014 Gallup Daily tracking survey, this study documented the distribution of worker well-being across 11 broad job categories among a national sample of employed adults in the United States. Well-being was measured by Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being 5™, a composite measure of five well-being dimensions (purpose, community, physical, financial, and social). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine how well-being varied across job categories and the extent to which household income modified that relationship, controlling for demographic factors.

Well-being varied significantly across job categories, even after adjusting for household income and demographic factors. Well-being was higher among business owners, professionals, managers, and farming/fishing workers and lower among clerical/office, service, manufacturing/production, and transportation workers. Purpose well-being (e.g., liking what you do and being motivated to achieve your goals) showed the greatest variability across job categories—there were small differences across income levels for business owners, professionals, managers, and farming/fishing workers, and statistically significant gaps between the high income group and the two lower income groups among clerical/office, service, manufacturing/production, and transportation workers. Physical well-being exhibited the smallest gaps across income groups within job categories.

The findings suggest that job category is an important component of worker well-being that extends beyond the financial dimension to purpose well-being. Our results suggest well-being inequity across job categories, and highlight areas for future research, policy and practice, including targeted interventions to promote worker and workplace well-being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Worker well-being in the United States: Finding variation across job categories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently an action plan has been put in place off southeastern Portugal, consisting in an offshore aquaculture area off the Armona sandy barrier island, Armona Pilot Production Aquaculture Area (APPAA). The infrastructure was created after the initiative of the Portuguese Government aiming to stimulate local employment opportunities related to seafood production. The APPAA aims to improve resilience of finfish and shellfish production for the future. However, the delimited infrastructure is located nearby some fishery-dependent communities. Therefore, such proximity may cause friction with some fishermen due to the limitations post APPAA development (e.g. may feel their jobs are threatened). In this study, we queried the reasoning rules elicited by local fishing communities and their perceived impact of the APPAA implementation. In that scope, a fuzzy logic expert system approach was used to investigate the interaction between three input variables (namely, ‘availability of fishable area’, ‘navigational disturbance’, and ‘catch variation’) and the output variable (i.e., overall ‘fishing community satisfaction’). The results from the fuzzy logic expert system showed that ‘catch variation’ was the input that most affected ‘fishing community satisfaction’ and seemed to be the one that suffered most changes. The results also show that, for the analyzed years, where the catch was higher, the degree of satisfaction tended to follow the trend, independently of the fishing community. The other two input variables were more conditioned by governmental arrangement (‘availability of fishable area’) and by small-scale fishermen reaction (‘navigational disturbance’). The fuzzy logic expert system proved to be a valuable tool, facilitating the analysis of governance arrangements, particularly those dealing with the interaction between the fisheries–offshore aquaculture system as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Perceived impact of offshore aquaculture area on small-scale fisheries: A fuzzy logic model approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compare three metagovernance arrangements, the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative, the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Good Aquaculture Practices, with respect to differences in their goals, their levels of inclusiveness, and their internal governance arrangement. The findings indicate that these metagovernance arrangements differ with respect to their goals and approaches and do not seem to directly reduce confusion.

"Abstract

Despite the recognised advantages of rural aquaculture, little research has been done to assess its direct and indirect impacts on food security and poverty mitigation, especially in Africa. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the role of fish-farming systems and their scale, market structure and institutional mechanisms in improving rural aquaculture in Mozambique and Namibia and, consequently, livelihoods and human development in rural communities.

This study shows that rural households are strongly dependent on agriculture/aquaculture as their main source of food and income. In general, families making a living from fish farming as their main activity have improved their access to food and basic services. There has been a significant increase in fish consumption in households since they have been engaged in rural fish farming, and there has also been an increase in the frequency of fish consumption per week. This progress in food and nutrition security needs to be consolidated through fish-farming development policies. However, rural aquaculture is still a sector in the early stages of development and has to overcome limiting factors such as a lack of specialised technical knowledge, logistical infrastructure and difficulties in access to credit and markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Are provisioning ecosystem services from rural aquaculture contributing to reduce hunger in Africa?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   Abstract
   
      
      In impoverished semi‐arid regions in the world, reservoirs serve multiple purposes, including food provision through fisheries and aquaculture. Yet, the socio‐economic benefits of promoting both activities remain unclear. We independently assessed the socio‐economic benefits generated from fisheries and aquaculture, in two reservoirs in the Brazilian semi‐arid region (June 2013 to June 2014). These reservoirs produced 27.75 ton of farmed tilapia over a year (USD Purchasing Power Parities [PPP] 88,778.73) and provided at least 16.5 ton of fish through fisheries (USD PPP 37,557.81), based on data from four farmer associations. Our input–output model revealed that the local economy depends on both activities, which, therefore, contribute similarly to providing goods and services to different branches. Aquaculture generated much higher revenues (seven times) than fisheries, but also much higher losses (the most successful farm yielded an average income of USD PPP 592.41 monthly). Still, there were no statistical differences in income among the compared associations. Fisheries provided very but guaranteed income (USD PPP 311.02 ± 82.94) and employed over three times as many people and contributed much more (>3 times) to food security than aquaculture. Encouraging aquaculture through specific policies while overlooking fisheries is not advisable because poor fishers would not be able to deal with unpredictable outcomes and it would put their food security at risk. However, if initial external support is provided to fishers in order to buffer large losses, aquaculture could represent a way out of poverty by generating an opportunity for larger gains, as long as potential negative ecological impacts of aquaculture are accounted for.

            Otoliths are inner‐ear structures of all teleost fish with functional importance for hearing and balance. The otoliths usually consist of aragonite, a polymorph of calcium carbonate, but may also take the form partly or entirely of vaterite, a different polymorph of calcium carbonate. Vateritic otoliths occur sporadically in wild fish, but with a higher frequency in hatchery‐reared fish. Abnormal otoliths have direct consequences for the inner‐ear functions of fish and may be a symptom of environmental stress. In this study, the authors assess the differences in the frequency of abnormal otoliths and degree of abnormality (% vaterite) for different groups of hatchery‐reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolt and adults. The groups differed in parental broodstock origin (number of generations in hatchery) and treatment temperature. Smolt from the same groups were also released to complete their ocean migration. The otoliths of the returning and recaptured adults were subsequently extracted to assess the difference in frequency and degree of abnormality between the adults and the smolt from corresponding groups. Return rate varied among groups (0.2%–2.6%). The frequency of vateritic otoliths was high (11.4%–64.4%) and differed among smolt groups. The lowest return rates corresponded with the highest frequency of abnormal otoliths for the groups, suggesting that abnormal otoliths may have negative consequences for marine survival. Furthermore, indications of an effect of fast growth on the formation of abnormal otoliths were found for only one of the experimental groups, and for none of the groups after correcting for Type 1 error. This contradicts previous reports, suggesting rapid growth as the main cause of abnormal otoliths. Adult return rates were generally low, but abnormal otoliths were common, with high coverage (% vaterite).

The results from the fuzzy logic expert system showed that ‘catch variation’ was the input that most affected ‘fishing community satisfaction’ and seemed to be the one that suffered most changes. The results also show that, for the analyzed years, where the catch was higher, the degree of satisfaction tended to follow the trend, independently of the fishing community. The other two input variables were more conditioned by governmental arrangement (‘availability of fishable area’) and by small-scale fishermen reaction (‘navigational disturbance’). The fuzzy logic expert system proved to be a valuable tool, facilitating the analysis of governance arrangements, particularly those dealing with the interaction between the fisheries–offshore aquaculture system as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

                        This paper applies two conceptual approaches, local institutions and global value chains. The concept of global value chains helps this paper to understand what extent the external pressures are placed on the industry while the concept of local institutions effectively examines its responses to the external pressures. Applying this conceptual framework this paper examines an empirical case analysing secondary data and literature.

                        Market requirements on food safety are brought by global buyers through the global value chains governance structure to the local institutional function. It includes local buyer-supplier relationship within the industrial cluster, industrial policy and business institutions, although it is less likely to address the local backwards suppliers to improve the industrial capability of food safety standard compliance.

                        This paper has a research limitation due to the prioritised research scope that critically examines potential pathway for further development of Vietnamese shrimp aquaculture export industry. Therefore, it needs further comparative in-depth analysis with more vertically organised industrial structure performed by the countries such as Thailand.

"Abstract

Culture of tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) and whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) has intensified during the last decade in China with increased production, meanwhile it has also brought some problems, including diseases, increased use of antimicrobials and other chemicals for disease control and pond water quality management. This study investigated the knowledge, practices and challenges of tilapia and whiteleg shrimp farmers when preventing and controlling diseases through the use of antimicrobials and other compounds in Guangdong province, which is the most important shrimp and tilapia production area in China. Tilapia farmers (25) mainly reported streptococcosis (9) and exophthalmia disease (9) which often was treated with sulfadiazine, florfenicol and vitamins or rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum) extract, although farmers thought the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatment has decreased in recent years. Shrimp farms (30) mainly experienced outbreaks of red body disease (19) and white spot syndrome (5), both viral diseases, and so-called “secret death disease” (5) which farmers controlled by application of a variety of disinfectants, probiotics and vitamins. Most of the farmers reported they did not use antimicrobials to treat shrimp disease. All farmers applied disinfectants and probiotics to control pond water quality although the efficacy of such use was not known. Farmers prepared their own medicated feed through mixing antimicrobial water-based solutions into the feed pellets with bare hands with small and medium scale farmers having little awareness of associated occupational health hazards. This practice together with inferior drug quality will lead farmers to administer sub-therapeutic antimicrobial concentrations with the subsequent risks of treatment failure and resistance development. Farmers stated lower costs and stricter regulation on antimicrobial usage as reasons for the popularity of probiotics. Farmers also reported the use of herbal extracts for disease control and water quality improvements, partly because of the low number of reported negative side effects and no antimicrobial residue problems. Local chemical supply shops, with representatives often visiting the farms, were important sources of information that farmers used when diagnosing and treating diseases. Farmers also relied on their own experience and current practices of chemical use do not seem cost-effective. Thus, government, academia, and the private sector should cooperate, e.g. in private–public partnerships, to improve advisory services and offer training to farmers, in particular on prudent and efficient use of antimicrobials and other compounds. Approval procedures and legislation of products used in aquaculture should be strengthened and enforced ensuring farmers' access to quality and efficient agents for disease control.

"Abstract

Japanese scallop landings are 400,000–600,000 mt and scallops are the most valuable in the Japanese mariculture industry. There are four species of scallop in Japan, but the scallop landed most is ‘hotategai’, Patinopecten (Mizuhopecten) yessoensis Jay. Scallop culture developed rapidly due to the technical advances of successful methods for natural spat collection and the intermediate culture in embayment seas in the mid-1960s. The scallop in Japan is currently produced by hanging culture and sowing culture. The processed scallop is mainly consumed in Japan, and it is also exported overseas, eg, the United States and China. New technology and continuous monitoring will be required, such as controlling cultured populations, culturing at low cost and producing goods of quality, to develop and maintain scallop culture industries in Japan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scallop Fisheries and Aquaculture in Japan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical, chemical and biological characteristics of seawaters are primary descriptors for understanding environmental patterns and improving maritime spatial planning for potential aquaculture uses. By analyzing these descriptors in spatial and temporal dimensions, it is possible to characterize the potential productivity performances of different locations for specific aquaculture species. We developed a toolbox that, starting from the actual competing uses of the maritime space, aims at: (a) identifying sites with conditions feasible for aquaculture fish growth (feasibility scenario); and (b) assessing their different productivity performances in terms of potential fish harvest (suitability scenario). The toolbox is being designed in the Mediterranean, northern Adriatic Sea, but because of its modularity/multi-stage process, it can be easily adapted to other areas, or scaled to larger areas. The toolbox, representing a pre-operational Copernicus downstreaming service that integrates data and products from different sources (in situ, Earth Observation and modeling), is innovative because it is based more on parameters relevant for fish vitality than on those oriented to farm functioning. Stakeholders and farmers involved in the maritime spatial planning can use resulting scenarios for decision-making and market-trading processes.

The results confirm some previous findings that educated, larger family size with better access to extension, market information and community-based organisation (CBO) are more likely to participate and continue in IAA value chain activities. Importantly, farm size and farm income does not matters for IAA value chain continuous participation, suggesting that IAA value chain activities are appropriate for resource-poor households who are only able to afford low-input technology. The results also indicate that the factors influencing continued participation and dis-participation of the IAA value chain activities especially for up and downstream activities are different.

"Abstract

Aquaculture provides more than half of the global seafood production and offers a wide diversity of high-quality products. However, its social acceptability is still not well established. The goal of this study was to determine the perceptions of aquaculture by different stakeholders along the seafood value chain in the Barcelona metropolitan area. The methodology used was based on a two-phase qualitative approach: the nominal group technique (NGT) and the Delphi survey. In the NGT phase, three groups, wholesalers, fishmongers and consumers, the latter divided into two subgroups according to the frequency of consumption of seafood, were used to collect and rank positive and negative perceptions about aquaculture. This information was subsequently used to build the questionnaire for the Delphi survey, which involved a group of experts from the board of the Wholesalers' Association, Fishmongers' Guild board and consumers' associations. Results showed that among the different stakeholders the highest concordance in positive aspects of aquaculture products included market issues and the stable quality of farmed products. On the other hand, the highest concordance in negative aspects included the lack of sufficient information about aquaculture, which was a serious issue for all stakeholders, and quality. Globally, animal welfare and environmental impact issues were not of much concern, although they included some minor positive and negative perceptions. The diversity of opinions among experts on certain aspects further emphasizes the need for more information, as they could have a potential role as information prescribers to consumers. We argue that information campaigns can take advantage of the positive perception of market issues (convenience, price, diversity) and quality stability to create a favourable predisposition towards aquaculture and thus help to introduce other problems in which perceptions generate a stronger debate. In communication or marketing campaigns, it is essential to highlight the quality and safety of farmed products, with a particular emphasis on the quality of fish feed as a guarantee of optimal nutritional and organoleptic properties of aquaculture products. Welfare and environment generate minor negative perceptions, so they should appear in campaigns, with a firm focus on the sustainability of the aquaculture sector, to improve its general image. In summary, the results of this study contribute to identifying the most relevant aspects to be taken into account to improve the public perception of aquaculture in the Barcelona area and may be of help in the design of similar efforts elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aquaculture perceptions in the Barcelona metropolitan area from fish and seafood wholesalers, fishmongers, and consumers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of using enzymatic ratios for the description of digestive system maturation in early life stages of S. officinalis. Second, it is intended to apply these new tools as eco-physiological indicators for understanding the impact of cuttlefish eggs’ life history from different spawning sites of the English Channel on digestive performance of juveniles. An experimental rearing was performed over 35 days after hatching (DAH) on juveniles from wild collected eggs in 2010 and 2011. Four digestive enzyme activities and their ratios [i.e., trypsin, cathepsin, acid (ACP), and alkaline (ALP) phosphatase, ALP/ACP, and trypsin/cathepsin] were studied along with histological features (e.g., internal yolk surface and digestive gland development). The two enzyme ratios were good indicators of digestive system maturation allowing the study of the digestive gland’s development. They were highly correlated to juveniles’ weight increase and histological features of the gland in early DAH. These ratios described more accurately the shift occurring between the intracellular acid and the extracellular alkaline modes of digestion in S. officinalis and were more specific than separated enzyme activities. Their application as eco-physiological tools revealed that enzyme ratios reflected yolk content and digestive gland development in new hatching juveniles. Finally, ALP/ACP ratio was shown to be a powerful tool to describe growth performance of S. officinalis which is useful for aquaculture optimization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Digestive enzyme ratios are good indicators of hatchling yolk reserve and digestive gland maturation in early life stages of cuttlefish Sepia officinalis L.: application of these new tools in ecology and aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Industrial aquaculture has become one of the main protagonists both on the coasts and in international policy aimed at regulating matters concerning the sea. This new role is reflected in the recently adopted Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union, where the need to promote the sector and the involvement with other local actors, specifically artisanal fishers, is highlighted. However, the official promotion of this activity could be overvaluing its benefits while, at the same time, undervaluing the new barriers that it is introducing in fisheries co-management. Centered in Valencian Community (Spain) and through a qualitative methodology, this paper examines the views and positions of stakeholders directly involved in aquaculture activity (biologists, aquaculture businessmen and policy managers) on the possibilities of joint participation. It is concluded, that eroding the detected mistrust among stakeholders through ""hybrid forms of participation"" would be a necessary prerequisite to setting up a common framework for involvement leading to an effective co-management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aquaculture stakeholders role in fisheries co-management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      We investigated the effects of circle hook size and angling technique on hooking location, capture success, and postrelease mortality in salmonids by using hatchery‐reared Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Fish were caught using a range of inline circle hook sizes (4, 6, 8, and 10) baited and fished both actively and passively. While hook size had no influence on capture rates, active fishing resulted in significantly higher capture rates. Very few mortalities (2%) were observed across angling methods or hook sizes during 72 h of postrelease monitoring. However, significantly more fish were deeply hooked with passive fishing. Contrary to claims by manufacturers and sportfishing entities, mounting evidence indicates that passively fished circle hooks have lower capture rates and might actually increase deep hooking in salmonids.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The influence of sea-cage aquaculture on wildfish assemblages has received little attention outside of Europe. Sea-cage aquaculture of finfish is a major focus in South Australia, and while the main species farmed is southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), there is also an important yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) industry. Yellowtail kingfish aquaculture did not appear to have any local or regional effects on demersal assemblages (primarily fish, but also some crustaceans) surveyed by baited remote underwater video (BRUV) in Fitzgerald Bay. We did, however, detect small scale spatial variations in assemblages within the bay. The type of bait used strongly influenced the assemblage recorded, with significantly greater numbers of fish attracted to deployments where sardines were used as the bait to compared to those with no bait. The pelleted feed used by the aquaculture industry was just as attractive as sardines at one site, and intermediate between sardines and no bait at the other. There was significant temporal variability in assemblages at both farm sites and one control site, while the second control site was temporally stable (over the 9 weeks of the study). Overall, the results suggested that aquaculture was having little if any impact on the abundance and assemblage structure of the demersal macrofauna in Fitzgerald Bay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The influence of finfish aquaculture on benthic fish and crustacean assemblages in Fitzgerald Bay, South Australia"

Among many rationales, the representation of diverse perspectives and participants in collaborative governance arrangements is expected to facilitate holistic understandings of complex public policy and management issues while promoting principles of democracy and inclusion. Such outcomes, however, are typically only achievable if the process of collaboration similarly engenders these principles. In this article, we investigate the dynamic relationship between diversity and perceived procedural justice in the context of 10 collaborative policymaking groups involved in guiding U.S. marine aquaculture policy development. Among our key findings is that certain types of participant diversity (i.e., affiliation and intergovernmental diversity) and diversity in beliefs about science and local knowledge are significantly associated with perceptions of procedural justice among participants within the collaborative groups. We also find that the relationship between participant diversity and perceived procedural justice is curvilinear; the positive effect of diversity is highest when the level of diversity is moderate (an inverted U-shaped pattern). We conclude our article with practical implications and suggestions for future research on procedural justice within collaborative partnerships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study demonstrated a significant change in fish community composition after mandarin fish stocking, but no fish extinction was observed. No significant difference was observed in the total density of 13 forage fish before and after mandarin fish stocking, but the total biomass showed a significant decline after mandarin fish stocking. Significant differences in length-frequency distributions were observed for Carassius auratus, Pseudorasbora parva and Toxabramis swinhonis captured before and after stocking mandarin fish. No significant change in habitat distribution was detected before and after mandarin fish stocking. A marked decline in total nitrogen and a slight decline in total phosphorus were observed while a slight increasing trend for Secchi depth was found after stocking. Our findings suggested that mandarin fish stocking can increase predation pressure on forage fish and subsequently optimize the food web structure.

Background

Workers may be exposed to various types of occupational hazards at the same time, potentially increasing the risk of adverse health outcomes. The aim of this review was to analyze the effects of multiple occupational exposures and coexposures to chemical, biomechanical, and physical hazards on adverse health outcomes among agricultural workers.

Methods

Articles published in English between 1990 and 2015 were identified using five popular databases and two complementary sources. The quality of the included publications was assessed using the methodology developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool for quantitative studies.

Results

Fifteen articles were included in the review. Multiple chemical exposures were significantly associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases, cancer, and DNA and cytogenetic damage. Multiple physical exposures seemed to increase the risk of hearing loss, whereas coexposures to physical and biomechanical hazards were associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders among agricultural workers.

Conclusion

Few studies have explored the impact of multiple occupational exposures on the health of agricultural workers.

The purpose of this literature review, the second in a series following one on traumatic injuries and fatigue, is to identify potential health hazards to inform a study of occupational health and safety among fish harvesters in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Fish harvesters are potentially at a high risk of occupational illnesses in GoM fisheries. GoM fishers engage in harvesting shrimp, finfish, oysters, crabs, and clams. Method: The method is a narrative literature review. Search terms that included safety, seafood, occupational, fishing, oyster, clam, shrimp, crab, and GoM were used to identify relevant literature in combination (i.e., a string search). Results: A total of 53 manuscripts were reviewed, of which only two regarded the GoM, but 19 were from the US Atlantic Coast. Musculoskeletal disorders are widespread across the fishing sector. Other hazards include bites and stings from aquatic animals (some of which may be life-threatening), vessel engine noise, dermatoses, and other skin afflictions (including possible strep infection of wounds), solar ray-induced eye diseases, and respiratory exposures (such as to protein aerosols) that can cause asthma. Diving poses multiple breathing and other hazards. Conclusion: While fish harvesters are protected from respiratory problems when working on the well-ventilated deck and dermal hazards by wearing gloves, musculoskeletal, bite and sting, ocular, engine-related hearing loss, and skin, lip, and eye cancer hazards are potentially serious risks among GoM fish harvesters.

The Norwegian fish farming industry is experiencing accidents that may have serious consequences for fish-farm operators, the environment, and the farmed fish themselves. Fatalities and serious personnel injuries, mass mortality of fish during and after operations, introgression of genes from farmed salmon, the spread of disease and material damage to assets are among the consequences. The reputation of the industry and the market value of its products may also suffer as a result of such incidents. Other industries have developed regulations aimed at preventing incidents called major accidents, which are usually defined as accidents that have different characteristics than occupational accidents. A holistic and efficient risk management system needs to cover all types of incidents. In spite of serious accidents, regulators have yet to adopt a holistic approach to the prevention of major accidents in Norwegian aquaculture. Here, we describe and discuss five main risk dimensions in the aquaculture industry that provide a holistic view of the complex risk picture of fish farming; fish welfare, personnel safety, risk to the environment, economic loss and food safety. Hazards that emerge in the fish production process and in the local environment, have consequences both for the fish farm and for society as a whole. On the basis of characteristics drawn from definitions of major accident regulations in other industries and the risk dimensions of fish farming, we propose a general definition of major accidents.

Agribusiness industries are among the most hazardous workplaces for non-fatal occupational injuries. The term “post-incident state” is used to describe the health status of an injured person when a non-fatal occupational injury has occurred, in the post-incident period when the worker returns to work, either immediately with zero days away from work (medical state) or after a disability period (disability state). An analysis of nearly 14,000 occupational incidents in agribusiness operations allowed for the classification of the post-incident state as medical or disability (77% and 23% of the cases, respectively). Due to substantial impacts of occupational incidents on labor-market outcomes, identifying factors that influence the severity of such incidents plays a significant role in improving workplace safety, protecting workers, and reducing costs of the post-incident state of an injury. In addition, the average costs of a disability state are significantly higher than those of a medical state. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the contributory factors to such post-incident states with logistic regression using information from workers’ compensation claims recorded between 2008 and 2016 in the Midwest region of the United States. The logistic regression equation was derived to calculate the odds of disability post-incident state. Results indicated that factors influencing the post-incident state included the injured body parts, injury nature, and worker’s age, experience, and occupation, as well as the industry, and were statistically significant predictors of post-incident states. Specific incidents predicting disability outcomes included being caught in/between/under, fall/slip/trip injury, and strain/injury by. The methodology and estimation results provide insightful understanding of the factors influencing medical/disability injuries, in addition to beneficial references for developing effective countermeasures for prevention of occupational incidents.

Worldwide and, especially, in developing countries, about 20% to 50% of the workers are exposed to health risks. Fishing is an ancient occupation, and like many others, it is characterized by numerous health risks and hazards. This study sought to understand the exposure of fisherfolk to human health risks, through fish handling and processing in Lake Baringo, Kenya. The study adopted a cross-sectional social survey design. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select respondents for this study. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to the respondents to collect data on risks involved during the handling and processing of fish. Key informant interviews and observation checklists were also used to collect more information. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. Inferential statistics included Pearson χ2 test, which was used to test the association of various factors on the encounter with occupational health risks. The level of significance was tested at α = 0.05. The study findings reveal the fisherfolk-encountered risks such as cuts, eye irritability, sunburns, skin burn, cold, falls, and musculoskeletal injuries during their work. The results showed that only 12% of the fisherfolk use personal protective equipments (PPEs) at work. Pearson χ2 test analysis showed there was an association between gender and gender roles (χ2 = 39.517, P < .05). In addition, an association was revealed between occupational health risks and gender (χ2 = 16.283, P < .05). There was also an association between occupational hazards and gender (χ2 = 21.352, P < .05). However, there was no association revealed between occupational health risk and marital status (χ2 = 1.305, P > .05) and PPEs (χ2 = 1.089, P > .05). Furthermore, results indicate that 61% of the fisherfolk who suffered from occupational health risks missed work. The study concludes that all the fisherfolk at Kampi Samaki are exposed to various health risks while working, which is thus likely to affect their health. We recommend public health campaigns to sensitize fisherfolk on the associated risks in fish handling and processing. There is also a need for health campaigns for the fisherfolk to appreciate the need for First Aid Kits during the fishing operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

The escape of fish from fish farms is a problem for the Norwegian aquaculture industry. Following a decrease in structural equipment failures, human errors and human factors have been highlighted as one of the main challenges when it comes to preventing fish escape.

The escape of fish from fish farms is a problem for the Norwegian aquaculture industry.

During 2000–2009, 116 Gulf of Mexico (GoM) fishers were killed (23% of the US total) while working in the shrimp, finfish, oyster, clam, and crab fisheries. The purpose of this literature review is to identify injury-related risk factors to better assess the frequency and severity of injuries experienced by fish harvesters in the GoM. Methods: The method of this study is a comprehensive narrative literature review of findings useful for the prevention of fatal and non-fatal injuries among GoM fish harvesters published since 2005. Search engine terms were used to identify relevant literature that included fatalities, injuries, fatigue, and several other terms in combination (e.g., string search with “fishing”). Results: We reviewed 48 articles; the most common cause of fish harvester deaths in the GoM is falls overboard with scant use of personal flotation devices and vessel disasters in which flooding and collision were the most lethal. The root cause of errors resulting in many disasters may have been operator fatigue, but fatigue is also an adverse health effect resulting from working conditions. Non-fatal injuries arise from multiple sources that include working with gears, slips and trips, struck-by or against objects, machine or line entanglements, and falls. Conclusion: Principal risk factors are a lack of sleep aboard fishing vessels, vessel flooding and collisions, poor weather, slips on deck, contact with gear, not wearing personal flotation devices, poor swimming ability, and fishing alone on a vessel or the deck.

"Abstract

Bivalve aquaculture is an expanding industry and there is a strong need for the identification of ecologically and socially feasible levels of aquaculture production in order to promote sustainable growth. In this context, the concept of carrying capacity serves to determine acceptable limits for aquaculture expansion. This study compares three case studies from different parts of the world where bivalve aquaculture represents an important socio-economic activity. Through a media analysis, public perception of aquaculture is analyzed and critical aspects shaping the process of societal discussion in the different settings are discussed. Public perception of aquaculture-related activities was mainly positive for all three case studies, and local socio-economic characteristics were found to likely to drive the process of social carrying capacity estimation. This work aims to provide a basis for the advancement of the definition of sustainable practices required for an Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture.

            Occupational exposure to foods is responsible for up to 25% of cases of occupational asthma and rhinitis. Animal and vegetable high‐molecular‐weight proteins present in aerosolized foods during food processing, additives, preservatives, antioxidants, and food contaminants are the main inhalant allergen sources. Most agents typically cause IgE‐mediated allergic reactions, causing a distinct form of food allergy (Class 3 food allergy). The allergenicity of a food protein, allergen exposure levels, and atopy are important risk factors. Diagnosis relies on a thorough medical and occupational history, functional assessment, assessment of sensitization, including component‐resolved diagnostics where appropriate, and in selected cases specific inhalation tests. Exposure assessment, including allergen determination, is a cornerstone for establishing preventive measures. Management includes allergen exposure avoidance or reduction (second best option), pharmacological treatment, assessment of impairment, and worker's compensation. Further studies are needed to identify and characterize major food allergens and define occupational exposure limits, evaluate the relative contribution of respiratory versus cutaneous sensitization to food antigens, evaluate the role of raw versus cooked food in influencing risk, and define the absolute or relative contraindication of patients with ingestion‐related food allergy, pollinosis, or oral allergy syndrome continuing to work with exposure to aerosolized food allergens.

Understanding the long-term dynamics of community livelihoods is an important step in designing appropriate fishery management and adaptation policies to navigate the effects of such transformations. The literature has focused predominantly on addressing snapshots of livelihood conditions, with less attention being paid to how present conditions have emerged over time, and for whom. Using an integrated analytical approach, this study investigates the longitudinal livelihood trajectories in two small-scale fishery villages around the Tam Giang Lagoon in Vietnam, with particular attention paid to the changes since the introduction of aquaculture in the late 1980s. Three distinct livelihood trajectories — accumulating, fluctuating, and marginalising — represent the differential pathways available to fishing- and aquaculture-dependent households. In this constrained yet shared resource space, the transformational adaptation through aquaculture has benefitted the adopters and enhanced their livelihood resilience; yet, it has had detrimental consequences for the artisanal fishers who find themselves locked into a state of heightened vulnerability. The findings provide evidence of differential and unintended consequences of new adaptations to livelihood struggles in small-scale fishery communities, and they point to the need for well-targeted policies to reduce rather than exacerbate growing inequalities. Fishery management policies and interventions in this lagoon, and similar contexts, need to take into account the heterogeneity in livelihood trajectories and unequal social vulnerability to inform more just adaptation strategies and improve the wellbeing of fishery communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Moving up or going under?

"Abstract

In 2014 the contribution of aquaculture to supply food for human consumption overtook wild-caught fish for the first time. Despite improvements in the aquaculture industry, it has been estimated that as much as 10% of all cultured aquatic animals are lost because of infectious diseases, amounting to >10 billion USD in losses annually on a global scale.

Vaccination to prevent disease is used routinely in finfish aquaculture, especially for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), while in a limited capacity (or not at all) in many other fish species due to lack of vaccines, poor performance or cost. There has, nevertheless, been impressive progress in fish vaccine development over the last 4 decades with 24 licenced fish vaccines now commercially available for use in a variety of fish species. These comprise whole killed, peptide subunit, recombinant protein, DNA and live attenuated vaccines.

Challenges do, however, still exist as the majority of commercial vaccines are killed whole cell pathogen preparations administered by intraperitoneal injection. This may not be the optimal route to deliver some vaccines, but lack of effective adjuvants and basic knowledge on immune response has hindered progress in the development of mucosal vaccines. The cost of injecting fish may also be prohibitive in some countries leading to disease treatment (e.g. with antibiotics) rather than using preventative measures. It is important that these issues are addressed as the industry continues to grow globally.

Exciting opportunities exist for rapid development of fish vaccines in the future, with continued reduction in cost of technologies (e.g. of whole genome sequencing), regulations changing (e.g. DNA vaccines can now authorised in Europe), the introduction of novel antigen expression and delivery systems (such as virus-like particles, VLPs), development of novel adjuvants and advancements in the elucidation of basic mechanisms of mucosal immunity. Development of effective mucosal vaccines and optimisation of their delivery will facilitate novel vaccine development, and enable the aquaculture industries in LMIC to use vaccination routinely in the future. In addition, effective use of emergency (autogenous) vaccines will assist in tackling emerging disease challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Progress, challenges and opportunities in fish vaccine development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Foodborne pathogens and occupational hazards are two primary safety concerns for U.S. beef slaughterhouses. The anthropogenic environmental impacts due to intensive resource use and pollution also exert threats to human health. Quantifying human health impacts from various sources remain a grand sustainability challenge for U.S. beef industry. We develop a framework to systematically estimate and compare human health impacts associated with U.S. beef foodborne illnesses from major pathogens and environmental impacts and occupational hazards from U.S. beef slaughtering on a common metric, disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Foodborne illnesses and occupational hazards are estimated by synthesizing published data and methodologies while environmental impacts are quantified using life cycle assessment. In spite of inherent uncertainties in estimation, results show that the environmental impacts and occupational hazards from beef slaughtering are of same magnitude with foodborne illnesses from beef consumption on human health. Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens contribute 51% and 28%, respectively, to the beef foodborne DALY; Global warming and fine particulate matter formation, due to electricity and natural gas use, are primary drivers for environmental DALY, accounting 62% and 28%, respectively. Occupational DALY is on average lower than environmental DALY from beef slaughtering and foodborne DALY. The impact of new food safety interventions that use additional resources to improve food safety should be considered jointly with environmental impacts and occupational hazards to avoid unintended shifts and net increase of human health impacts. The methodology and results from this study provide a new perspective on reforms of the U.S. food safety regulations building toward sustainability in the food processing industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Environmental and occupational impacts from U.S. beef slaughtering are of same magnitude of beef foodborne illnesses on human health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half of the seafood consumed globally now comes from aquaculture, or farmed seafood. Aquaculture therefore plays an increasingly important role in the global food system, the environment, and human health. Traditionally, aquaculture feed has contained high levels of wild fish, which is unsustainable for ocean ecosystems as demand grows. The aquaculture industry is shifting to crop-based feed ingredients, such as soy, to replace wild fish as a feed source and allow for continued industry growth. This shift fundamentally links seafood production to terrestrial agriculture, and multidisciplinary research is needed to understand the ecological and environmental health implications. We provide basic estimates of the agricultural resource use associated with producing the top five crops used in commercial aquaculture feed. Aquaculture's environmental footprint may now include nutrient and pesticide runoff from industrial crop production, and depending on where and how feed crops are produced, could be indirectly linked to associated negative health outcomes. We summarize key environmental health research on health effects associated with exposure to air, water, and soil contaminated by industrial crop production. Our review also finds that changes in the nutritional content of farmed seafood products due to altered feed composition could impact human nutrition. Based on our literature reviews and estimates of resource use, we present a conceptual framework describing the potential links between increasing use of crop-based ingredients in aquaculture and human health. Additional data and geographic sourcing information for crop-based ingredients are needed to fully assess the environmental health implications of this trend. This is especially critical in the context of a food system that is using both aquatic and terrestrial resources at unsustainable rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Environmental health impacts of feeding crops to farmed fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This serves to de-animalize and commodify certain animals, which fosters an emotional detachment from them. In contrast to research which suggests that emotions switch off and on in a dialectic between violence and non-violence, or that we are living in a post-emotional society, we elucidate the co-existence, fluidity and range of emotions that surface and submerge at work.

Specific real-time PCR analyses revealed the presence of C. psittaci in all flocks but with three different shedding patterns involving ducks about the age of 4, 8, and 12 weeks with heavy, moderate, and low excretion levels, respectively. Air samples were only positive in flocks harboring heavy shedders. Dust in flocks with heavy or moderate shedders carried chlamydial loads strongly associated with the loads detected in avian and soil samples. Environmental contamination, significantly correlated with shedding dynamics, was considered to be the most probable source of exposure. The high prevalence of bacteriophage Chp1 in all flocks, mostly jointly present with chlamydia, suggests an important factor in C. psittaci persistence, thus creating a greater risk for humans. A survey conducted in these flocks regarding farming practices and activities showed that disinfection seems to be the most promising practice for reducing C. psittaci prevalence in ducks and that the place and the duration of action during operations seem to be potential risk factors. Strict adherence to good practices is strongly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Assessment of Chlamydia psittaci Shedding and Environmental Contamination as Potential Sources of Worker Exposure throughout the Mule Duck Breeding Process,Assessment of Chlamydia psittaci Shedding and Environmental Contamination as Potential Sources of Worker Exposure throughout the Mule Duck Breeding Process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics. There is expanding interest in aquaponics as a form of aquaculture that can be used to produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics production, and the purpose of this research was to document the production methods, crop and fish yields, and profitability of commercial aquaponics in the United States (US) and internationally. An online survey was used for data collection, and 257 respondents met the inclusion criteria for the study. Eighty-one percent of respondents lived in the US, and the remaining respondents were from 22 other countries. The median year that respondents had begun practicing aquaponics was 2010. A total of 538 full-time workers, 242 part-time workers, and 1720 unpaid workers or volunteers were employed at surveyed organizations. The most commonly raised aquatic animals by percent were tilapia (69%), ornamental fish (43%), catfish (25%), other aquatic animals (18%), perch (16%), bluegill (15%), trout (10%), and bass (7%). Production statistics, gross sales revenue, investments, and sales outlets for operations are reported and compared to other fields of aquaculture and agriculture. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to study which factors were associated with profitability (as a binary outcome) in the past 12 months. Several factors were significantly associated with profitability: aquaponics as the respondents' primary source of income (p < 0.01; Odds Ratio: 5.79; 95% Confidence Interval: 3.8–9.0), location in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7–13 (p < 0.01; OR: 4.17; 95% CI: 3.2–5.5), gross sales revenue ≥$5000 (p < 0.01; OR: 3.58; 95% CI: 2.2–5.8), greater aquaponics knowledge (p < 0.01; OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 2.0–2.9), and sales of non-food products (e.g., supplies, materials, consulting services, workshops, and agrotourism) (p = 0.028; OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.1–4.2). Our survey findings provide a better understanding of the business of aquaponics, which may enhance future commercial operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our article focuses on the region of Chilean Patagonia and considers how it has developed as a leading producer of salmon for global food markets. It addresses the problem of how to decentre conventional views of the forces driving regional development that give primacy to the role of capital and technology, instead giving due recognition to the knowledge and practices of situated actors and to the relationships that form between human and non-human entities in food producing regions. As an alternative, we ask whether an assemblage approach can improve our understanding of regional transformation. To explore this question, we present original ethnographic data on constitutive practices that have transformed the Patagonian region, from the territorialization of Salmonidae species to experimentation in ocean ranching and seawater fish farming, and finally the development of a global industry. The evidence leads us to argue that in a complex globalised world, assemblage theory offers a valuable approach for understanding how regional potential is realised. In the case of Chilean Patagonia, it is apparent that forms of bio-power generate new relations between life, agency and nature, stimulating contemporary regional transformations in ways overlooked by the lineal logic of capital objectification discourses. Applying an assemblage approach enables the significance of new contemporary human – non-human relationships and inter-subjectivities to come to the fore, keeping the social in view as potential for regional transformation and new power asymmetries continuously emerge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Becoming a region, becoming global, becoming imperceptible: Territorialising salmon in Chilean Patagonia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The economic and environmental sustainability of aquaculture depends significantly on the nature and quality of the fish feed used. One of the main criticisms of aquaculture is the need to use significant amounts of fish meal, and other marine protein sources, in such feed. Unfortunately, the availability of the oceanic resources, typically used to produce fish feed, cannot be utilized indefinitely to cover the worldwide feed demand caused by ever-increasing aquaculture production. In light of these considerations, this study estimates how aquaculture farm economic outcomes can change by introducing insect meal into the diet of cultivated fish. Several possible economic effects are simulated, based on various scenarios, with different percentages of insect flour in the feed and varying meal prices using a case study of a specialized off-shore sea bass farm in Italy. The findings indicate that the introduction of insect meal—composed of Tenebrio molitor—would increase feeding costs due to the high market prices of this flour and its less convenient feed conversion ratio than that of fish meal. Therefore, the expected environmental benefits of using this highly promising insect meal in fish feed do not align with the current economic interests of the aquaculture industry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate this theme, and it must be noted that our findings cannot be generalized widely because a specific case study was used. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that efforts should be made—at least at the farm level—to find profitable ways to encourage the introduction of this attractive alternative to guarantee both economic and environmental sustainability in the near future.

Although marine fishing is one of the most hazardous occupations, research on the occupational safety and health (OSH) conditions aboard marine fishing vessels is scarce. For instance, little is known about the working conditions of vulnerable groups such as young and aging fishermen. The objective of the current paper is to study the OSH conditions of young and aging fishermen compared to middle-aged fishermen in the small- and medium-size (SM) marine fishing sector. A cross-sectional study was designed, and 686 fishermen working aboard SM fishing vessels were interviewed to collect information about their safety and health. The associations of physical and psychosocial work conditions with safety and health outcomes, e.g., injuries, illnesses and job satisfaction, are presented. The results of the current study can be utilized in the design of effective accident prevention and OSH training programs for the three age groups and in the regulation of working conditions aboard fishing vessels.

"Abstract

In 2013, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) was listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants obligated to be phased out worldwide. China is a major producer and user of HBCD. Based on Chinese HBCD production and processing conditions, we classified the existing 599 HBCD production and processing plants into six occupational exposure scenarios. We also used occupational environmental monitoring and occupational health risk assessment models to estimate exposure levels. Occupational internal exposure levels for HBCD in China were estimated to range from 0.61 to 840 μg kg−1 d−1, which suggests that approximately 453–840 workers, or 72% of all workers in this industry, may have occupational exposure risk. As such, the occupational risks of HBCD should not be ignored. In our study area, HPLC-MS/MS revealed HBCD concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 560 ng g dry weight (dw)−1, 20.4–24.2 ng g dw−1, and 166–1964 ng g lipid weight (lw)−1 in soil, sediment, and biological samples, respectively, consistent with previous monitoring results. These data suggest potential risk to marine environments due to sustained and large-scale HBCD production and processing. Thus, timely measures to control HBCD-related risk are necessary and may bring significant occupational health and environmental benefits in areas where HBCD is prevalent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Assessment of the occupational and environmental risks of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster heavily affected Indonesia, particularly Aceh Province, leaving devastating impacts to people and their livelihoods. The tsunami wiped out coastal areas, causing permanent land loss and destroying aquaculture ponds and mangrove forests. This resulted in disruption in the community's sources of income, especially to those who rely on aquaculture activities as well as on gathering resources from the sea. This paper analyses households’ livelihood changes in Pande Village, Banda Aceh City by assessing livelihood assets before, immediately after, and 12 years after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster in Indonesia. Data from 77 households were collected in a survey conducted in September 2016. This study tracked the changes in the human, financial, physical, natural, and social assets of the households to understand how these changes led to livelihood outcomes and eventually to disaster recovery. One of the findings is that the destruction of aquaculture ponds and mangroves significantly reduced the potential of reviving livelihoods that were mainly relying on coastal resources. As a consequence, households took up non-aquaculture livelihood activities, such as going into business, driving rickshaws, and providing manual labour, to support their family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Livelihood changes in Banda Aceh, Indonesia after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

This paper analyzes the complementarities between land productivity and conservation investments in the context of river embankment maintenance in the Indian Sundarbans. The study finds that households whose principal occupation is aquaculture commit more resources to embankment maintenance relative to those in non-aquaculture employment. While conservation efforts are greater in all types of aquaculture plots irrespective of distance from the embankments, such efforts unambiguously decrease for agricultural plots that are located at a distance from the embankments. Private returns to traditional aquaculture are much higher than returns to agriculture, enabling aquaculture households in invest in managing their local public good. However, there is evidence of free riding in canal-based aquaculture when multiple users draw water from a single source. Head-enders with greater wealth as well as intense social networks tend to free-ride while tail-enders with less land holdings contribute more towards canal maintenance. Furthermore, public intervention in embankment maintenance may be crowding out private efforts. Thus, in primarily agricultural areas, productivity-enhancing policies like adoption of salt tolerant crops with supportive extension activities may be more efficient than policies that fully subsidize public good maintenance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Flood risk, land use and private participation in embankment maintenance in Indian Sundarbans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An employee with no prior history of allergy or asthma, experienced respiratory and flu-like symptoms during production of shrimp shell powder in a seafood savory factory in Norway. We aimed to clarify the diagnosis and to identify the cause of the symptoms by specific inhalation challenge (SIC) and by characterizing the powder's biocontaminants, particle size fractions and inflammatory potential.

Methods

Respiratory and immunological responses were measured the day before and after each of four challenges with 20–150 g shrimp shell powder during three consecutive days. The powder was analyzed for endotoxin, microorganisms and particle size fractions by standardized laboratory methods. Total inflammatory potential was quantified by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a granulocyte assay.

Results

The patient had elevated IgG, but not IgE, towards shrimp shell powder. 20 min challenge with 150 g shrimp shell powder induced 15% decrease in FVC, 23% decrease in FEV1 and increased unspecific bronchial reactivity by methacholine. Neutrophils and monocytes increased 84% and 59%, respectively, and the patient experienced temperature increase and flu-like symptoms. The shrimp shell powder contained 1118 endotoxin units/g and bacteria including Bacillus cereus, and 57% respirable size fraction when aerosolized. The ROS production was higher for shrimp shell powder than for endotoxin alone.

Conclusions

Endotoxin and other bacterial components combined with a high fraction of respirable dust might be the cause of the symptoms. The patient's characteristics and response to SIC were best compatible with occupational asthma and organic dust toxic syndrome, while hypersensitivity pneumonitis could not be excluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pulmonary illness as a consequence of occupational exposure to shrimp shell powder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We pay particular attention to migration routes, labour conditions, and worker mobility, along with worker reflections on their experiences landing a Canadian job. We also consider the perceptions of migrant workers among company staff. We argue that despite the various unfreedoms associated with migrant worker programs, migrant workers in this particular facility have demonstrated agency in negotiating the program to their advantages. The success of the workers, however, is contingent on a conjuncture of elements that are not necessarily found elsewhere in the seafood processing industry. Worker experiences, both with other Canadian employers and elsewhere, offer a stark contrast to their current situation: migrant workers often experience significant unfreedoms to gain relatively free working conditions.

Resource users’ perceptions are crucial for successful marine governance because they affect community support, participation and legitimacy. Efforts have been made to understand how fishers’ attitudes, understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which humans arrive at their views about the world – the social group. In multi-gear fisheries, fishers typically cluster in two overlapping types of group: occupational groups (defined by fishing gear) and village communities. Taking into account also individual-level variables, which group type is more associated with particular environmental and governance perceptions, e.g. about change in fish stocks, collective action or appropriate management actions? Through questionnaires in combination with multivariate and multi-model inference, this study reveals that, among fishers in two villages in Zanzibar (n = 172), village is more associated with perceptions than occupational group or any other factor. Further, individual attributes like education and age influence perceptions. The main finding implies that the role of social-cultural processes might have been underestimated in quantitative research on research users’ perceptions. This has consequences for policy and research and shows that both can be informed by statistical analyses that disentangles effects of different levels of group belonging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Overlapping identities: The role of village and occupational group for small-scale fishers’ perceptions on environment and governance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCRPEC carriage was associated with provincial regions, the production of sheep and freshwater aquaculture, annual consumption of total meat, pork and mutton, and daily intake of aquaculture products. MCRPEC was significantly more prevalent in provinces with higher aquaculture industries. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that the MCRPEC isolates were clustered into four distinct lineages, two of which were dominant and harboured most of the MCRPEC isolates. The high prevalence of MCRPEC in the community poses a substantial risk for colistin usage in clinical practice and suggests the need for intestinal screening of mcr-1 carriers in intensive care units in Chinese hospitals. Furthermore, our data suggest that aquaculture is a significant reservoir of mcr-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anthropogenic and environmental factors associated with high incidence of mcr-1 carriage in humans across China,,,,,,,,,,

Resource users’ perceptions are crucial for successful marine governance because they affect community support, participation and legitimacy. Efforts have been made to understand how fishers’ attitudes, understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which humans arrive at their views about the world – the social group.

The issue of “safe working” has received increasing concern in recent years worldwide, especially in Europe. Several European countries developed specific strategies to ensure the safety of operators and the awareness on the potential risks that can emerge from a vast set of activities, including field activity in agriculture. Earlier investigations have lately investigated this topic, proposing quali-quantitative analysis applied to specific economic sectors. The present study focused on the working accidents occurred in agriculture over the last 6 years (2012–2017) in Italy. By exploring where and when injuries occurred, the socio-demographic profile of involved persons (including age, gender, nationality) and correlating these episodes to agricultural practices, the present paper reveals intrinsic patterns of safe (or unsafe) working conditions at a quite detailed spatial scale (administrative provinces) in Italy. Based on these results, training/educational programs should be planned to increase awareness of risks involving workers in agriculture. Future scenarios can be explored based on specific information dealing with risk factors and operating conditions at various working sites with the final objective to establish suitable technical, legislative and operational measures to reduce job accidents.

"Abstract
Objectives

An employee with no prior history of allergy or asthma, experienced respiratory and flu-like symptoms during production of shrimp shell powder in a seafood savory factory in Norway. We aimed to clarify the diagnosis and to identify the cause of the symptoms by specific inhalation challenge (SIC) and by characterizing the powder's biocontaminants, particle size fractions and inflammatory potential.

Methods

Respiratory and immunological responses were measured the day before and after each of four challenges with 20–150 g shrimp shell powder during three consecutive days. The powder was analyzed for endotoxin, microorganisms and particle size fractions by standardized laboratory methods. Total inflammatory potential was quantified by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a granulocyte assay.

Results

The patient had elevated IgG, but not IgE, towards shrimp shell powder. 20 min challenge with 150 g shrimp shell powder induced 15% decrease in FVC, 23% decrease in FEV1 and increased unspecific bronchial reactivity by methacholine. Neutrophils and monocytes increased 84% and 59%, respectively, and the patient experienced temperature increase and flu-like symptoms. The shrimp shell powder contained 1118 endotoxin units/g and bacteria including Bacillus cereus, and 57% respirable size fraction when aerosolized. The ROS production was higher for shrimp shell powder than for endotoxin alone.

Conclusions

Endotoxin and other bacterial components combined with a high fraction of respirable dust might be the cause of the symptoms. The patient's characteristics and response to SIC were best compatible with occupational asthma and organic dust toxic syndrome, while hypersensitivity pneumonitis could not be excluded.",,,,,,,,,,,"In coastal ecosystems, suspension-feeding bivalves can remove nitrogen though uptake and assimilation or enhanced denitrification.

"Abstract

This paper analyzes the complementarities between land productivity and conservation investments in the context of river embankment maintenance in the Indian Sundarbans. The study finds that households whose principal occupation is aquaculture commit more resources to embankment maintenance relative to those in non-aquaculture employment. While conservation efforts are greater in all types of aquaculture plots irrespective of distance from the embankments, such efforts unambiguously decrease for agricultural plots that are located at a distance from the embankments. Private returns to traditional aquaculture are much higher than returns to agriculture, enabling aquaculture households in invest in managing their local public good. However, there is evidence of free riding in canal-based aquaculture when multiple users draw water from a single source. Head-enders with greater wealth as well as intense social networks tend to free-ride while tail-enders with less land holdings contribute more towards canal maintenance. Furthermore, public intervention in embankment maintenance may be crowding out private efforts. Thus, in primarily agricultural areas, productivity-enhancing policies like adoption of salt tolerant crops with supportive extension activities may be more efficient than policies that fully subsidize public good maintenance.",,,,,,,,,,,"This research explores: (1) the occupational identity of fish and wildlife police agencies and (2) considers an emerging concern that these agencies have widened their work priorities to include more traditional law enforcement. To investigate these issues a content analysis of state level law enforcement agency websites with a fish and wildlife focus is used to better understand how they self-identify (agency name and job titles), their mission statements, the scope of power sworn officers have (limited to special purpose or inclusive of general law enforcement powers), and the educational and training requirements to support their stated agency missions. The findings demonstrate fish and wildlife police agencies are engaged in a scope of work that supports a general law enforcement role. This study demonstrates many fish and wildlife police agencies and their officers appear to be transitioning roles into more generalized law enforcement officers, but this change is not universal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What’s in a Name?

Work migration is increasing in Norway, particularly in the production sector of the aquaculture industry. This sector is growing rapidly and manual labor needed in the industry is consistently being sought through Eastern European networks and temp-agencies. This article looks at the island community of Frøya, in Sør Trøndelag in Norway, where around 20% of the population is of foreign descent, and where stakeholders in the production line experience a lack of upward mobility due to their lack of Norwegian language skills, and the insecure nature of their employment status. The capacity of the island community to adapt to a 3-fold increase in aquaculture production will depend on this segment of society as well being able to adjust, and on their inclusiveness in society. Based on a stakeholder driven workshop looking at the perceptions of a set of foreign workers in the aquaculture industry,segmented labor market theory was applied to the experience of the workers. The priority issues of the migrant population of Frøya involved in the aquaculture industry was also explained, and their wish for upward mobility and job security, as well as inclusiveness in society elaborated upon. This upward mobility, however, would lead to the bottom segment of the labor market on Frøya – the aquaculture production line – to have to be filled with another lower segment group of workers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Work segmentation in the Norwegian salmon industry: The application of segmented labor market theory to work migrants on the island community of Frøya, Norway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Job satisfaction has been widely regarded as an important component of well-being especially among fishermen because the occupation of fishing includes attributes of ‘adventure,’ ‘challenge,’ and ‘being outdoors’ infrequently found in other employment. It has been previously demonstrated that management driven changes to fishing communities can directly and indirectly affect aspects of fishermen’s job satisfaction and, consequently, their well-being. This paper presents a unique through time comparison of job satisfaction among fishermen between three time periods (1977, 2009/10, and 2013/14) in two major New England fishing ports: New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Point Judith, Rhode Island. Results show important differences between the three time-periods analyzed that can be associated with important changes in fisheries management in the last few decades. Differences found between ports also emphasize important socio-cultural aspects influencing job satisfaction and well-being in fishing communities. This study demonstrates that job satisfaction variables are valuable indicators of change in the context of fisheries and therefore provide valuable information for the development of future management plans that take into account important aspects of fishing community well-being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Changes in Job Satisfaction Through Time in Two Major New England Fishing Ports,,,,,,,,,,

The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster heavily affected Indonesia, particularly Aceh Province, leaving devastating impacts to people and their livelihoods. The tsunami wiped out coastal areas, causing permanent land loss and destroying aquaculture ponds and mangrove forests. This resulted in disruption in the community's sources of income, especially to those who rely on aquaculture activities as well as on gathering resources from the sea. This paper analyses households’ livelihood changes in Pande Village, Banda Aceh City by assessing livelihood assets before, immediately after, and 12 years after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster in Indonesia. Data from 77 households were collected in a survey conducted in September 2016. This study tracked the changes in the human, financial, physical, natural, and social assets of the households to understand how these changes led to livelihood outcomes and eventually to disaster recovery. One of the findings is that the destruction of aquaculture ponds and mangroves significantly reduced the potential of reviving livelihoods that were mainly relying on coastal resources. As a consequence, households took up non-aquaculture livelihood activities, such as going into business, driving rickshaws, and providing manual labour, to support their family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aquaculture production is increasing in Vietnam, but is hampered by frequent disease outbreaks and widespread use of various compounds used to treat the fish and shrimp. The objective of this study was to analyse factors influencing farmer use practices of antimicrobials and other compounds by a questionnaire and observational survey conducted with 60 whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and 25 fish farmers in three coastal provinces in Northern Vietnam. Personnel in 22 shops distributing feed and chemicals for aquaculture were interviewed about their advice on sale to the farmers. Results showed that 20 different antimicrobial products were used for disease prevention and treatment in shrimp and marine fish culture. Banned products used included chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin and malachite green. Cage fish farmers said they purchased antimicrobial tablets readily available at a local pharmacy and sold for human use. Chinese traders were the main drug suppliers to the shrimp farmers in Quang Ninh and others provinces. Their products were sold with labels and product information written in Chinese only. Farmers appeared to have little awareness and concern about the disease aetiology when applying specific antimicrobials.

To date, most of the studies examining farmer’s vulnerability and adaption to climate change have been agriculture-focused with little attention to the impacts on other livelihood systems. Based on a case study approach our study presents: i) how local people perceive climate change and whether it corresponds to meteorological records, ii) what climate change impacts people consider significant, and iii) what strategies the shrimp farmers employ to ameliorate perceived risks. This study was conducted using local climate data, focus groups and household survey in Mongla sub-district. This study shows that local people are aware of the changes in hydro-climatic parameters. Their accounts of climate change mostly diverge from the scientific evidence when long-term climate trends are considered, but on short-term variability, the correlation between scientific evidence and local perceptions is high. Repeated adverse impacts caused by climate stressors on livelihood activities shape people’s climate risk perceptions. In relation to perceived risks, farmers have made adjustments in their aquaculture practices. Yet, the level of responses clearly lags behind the extent to which concerns about climate disturbances are expressed. This is partly due to farmers’ efforts for managing transformation from agricultural livelihood system to aquaculture-based livelihood systems and partly associated with other social factors.

The seafood sector in Norway has an extensive innovation system and a high research and development (R&D) intensity, where public R&D institutions receive much of the funding. Our econometric estimates imply that firms with internal R&D resources collaborate more with external organizations in general, and research institutions in particular. Internal skills in the form of R&D employees and external collaboration with firms in the value chain have highly significant positive effects on innovation rates. Collaboration with R&D institutions has a smaller direct effect on innovation. Innovation is clustered at the beginning and end of the supply chain. Aquaculture input suppliers are highly innovative, while aquaculture farms mainly incorporate innovations from suppliers.",,,,,,,,,,Abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Innovation in seafood value chains: the case of Norway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Abstract
      
         
         We assessed the effects of rearing conditions in four hatchery programs from the upper Columbia River basin on the survival and demographics of yearling summer Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha over four release years. Juveniles from each hatchery program were initially reared at Eastbank Hatchery near Wenatchee, Washington, (which uses groundwater for fish rearing) and experienced similar rearing temperatures until their first autumn in culture. Fish that were to be used for two of the programs were subsequently transferred to surface water acclimation sites, where they were reared until release the following spring (surface water winter rearing). Fish to be used for the other two programs were overwintered at the Eastbank Hatchery and then transferred to their acclimation and release sites 1 to 2 months before spring release (groundwater winter rearing). Fish from the two rearing strategies experienced contrasting temperature profiles, which in turn affected winter growth, age at maturation, and smolt‐to‐adult survival (SAS). Overall, the two release groups that were overwintered in colder surface water experienced reduced winter growth, reduced minijack rate, and smaller size at release, but achieved a two‐ to threefold higher SAS than did the two release groups overwintered in warmer groundwater at Eastbank Hatchery. In addition, based on migration data compiled from fish tagged with PIT tags, smaller juveniles tended to mature at older age‐classes than did larger smolts. We concluded that rearing yearling hatchery summer Chinook Salmon under more natural thermal regimes (surface water) may result in the return of larger, older adults that have a higher survival rate than would fish reared under constant or less natural thermal regimes (ground water). These results highlight the importance of the hatchery‐rearing environment in shaping the survival and life history of summer Chinook Salmon juveniles released into the Columbia River basin.

,,,,,,,,,,,"Millions of people around the world depend on shrimp aquaculture for their livelihoods. Yet, the phenomenal growth of shrimp farming has often given rise to considerable environmental and social damage. This article examines the impacts of commercial, export-oriented shrimp aquaculture on local livelihood vulnerability by comparing the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of shrimp farm employees with non-farm employees in rural Mozambique. Exposure to stressors was similar between the two groups. Shrimp farm employees had higher assets and higher adaptive capacity than non-farm employees. However, because their income is heavily dependent on a single commodity, shrimp farm employees were highly susceptible to the boom crop nature of intensive shrimp farming. The implications for aquaculture policy and vulnerability research are discussed. The article argues that coastal vulnerability is dynamic, variable, and influenced by multiple processes operating at multiple scales.

Based on the average level of seafood consumption in the United States (U.S.), the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourages citizens to double their intake to improve the health of their diets. The future availability of seafood, however, is threatened by overfishing, unsustainable seafood farming practices, ocean pollution and acidification, and other factors. The growing global population and advancing ecological threats such as climate change are placing increasing demands and constraints on U.S. and global seafood supplies. Waste reduction has the potential to support increased seafood consumption without further stressing aquatic resources. It is essential to quantify waste levels in order to effectively target and design waste reduction interventions. Accordingly, we used previous multi-country regional research and updated datasets to calculate a country-specific (U.S.) estimate of seafood loss for the years 2009–2013. We estimate that 40–47% of the edible U.S. seafood supply went uneaten in this period. The greatest portions of this loss occurred at the levels of consumers (in and out of home) (51–63% of loss attributed to consumption), bycatch discarded by commercial fishers (16–32%), and in distribution and retail operations (13–16%). Based on conservative estimates, this waste represents 208 billion grams of protein, 1.8 trillion mg of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids), and 1.1 trillion kilocalories. The seafood that is lost could fill 36% of the gap between current consumption and U.S. Department of Agriculture-recommended levels. As another way of understanding the magnitude of loss, this lost seafood could provide the total yearly target quantity of protein for 10.1 million men or 12.4 million women, EPA + DHA for 20.1 million adults, and calories for 1.5 million adults. The lost nutrition estimates we provide are meant to be illustrative of the issue’s significance and magnitude. While a significant portion of the loss could be prevented or recovered for human consumption, we do not intend to suggest that all of it could or should become food for humans. Bycatch is generally best left in the water; some seafood loss is not culturally acceptable, marketable, nutritious or safe; and a portion of loss is also unavoidable. Instead, we discuss waste prevention strategies involving governments, businesses, and consumers that can be employed to reduce seafood loss and create a more efficient and sustainable seafood system..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wasted seafood in the United States: Quantifying loss from production to consumption and moving toward solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aquaculture is one of the most rapidly expanding farming systems in the world. Its rapid expansion has brought with it several pathogens infecting different fish species. As a result, there has been a corresponding expansion in vaccine development to cope with the increasing number of infectious diseases in aquaculture. The success of vaccine development for bacterial diseases in aquaculture is largely attributed to empirical vaccine designs based on inactivation of whole cell (WCI) bacteria vaccines. However, an upcoming challenge in vaccine design is the increase of intracellular bacterial pathogens that are not responsive to WCI vaccines. Intracellular bacterial vaccines evoke cellular mediated immune (CMI) responses that “kill” and eliminate infected cells, unlike WCI vaccines that induce humoral immune responses whose protective mechanism is neutralization of extracellular replicating pathogens by antibodies. In this synopsis, I provide an overview of the intracellular bacterial pathogens infecting different fish species in aquaculture, outlining their mechanisms of invasion, replication, and survival intracellularly based on existing data. I also bring into perspective the current state of CMI understanding in fish together with its potential application in vaccine development. Further, I highlight the immunological pitfalls that have derailed our ability to produce protective vaccines against intracellular pathogens for finfish. Overall, the synopsis put forth herein advocates for a shift in vaccine design to include CMI-based vaccines against intracellular pathogens currently adversely affecting the aquaculture industry.

            Fishing industry workers are exposed to hazardous working conditions, engage in strenuous labor, and work long hours in variable weather conditions. Despite these known employment challenges, little is known of their perceived occupational health and safety concerns. In this pilot study, we: (1) describe fishermen's perceptions on worker‐ and organizational‐level characteristics that impact occupational health and safety; and (2) estimate environmental exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) encountered during fishing activities.

A graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet-modified N+-nylon membrane (GOM) has been prepared and used as an extraction and spray-ionization substrate for robust mass spectrometric detection of malachite green (MG), a highly toxic disinfectant in liquid samples and fish meat. The GOM is prepared by self-deposition of GO thin film onto an N+-nylon membrane, which has been used for efficient extraction of MG in aquaculture water samples or homogenized fish meat samples. Having a dissociation constant of 2.17 × 10−9 M−1, the GOM allows extraction of approximately 98% of 100 nM MG. Coupling of the GOM-spray with an ion-trap mass spectrometer allows quantitation of MG in aquaculture freshwater and seawater samples down to nanomolar levels. Furthermore, the system possesses high selectivity and sensitivity for the quantitation of MG and its metabolite (leucomalachite green) in fish meat samples. With easy extraction and efficient spray ionization properties of GOM, this membrane spray-mass spectrometry technique is relatively simple and fast in comparison to the traditional LC-MS/MS methods for the quantitation of MG and its metabolite in aquaculture products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Graphene oxide membrane as an efficient extraction and ionization substrate for spray-mass spectrometric analysis of malachite green and its metabolite in fish samples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

Very limited information is available on the relationship between dietary selenium (Se) and plant protein (PP) sources in carnivorous marine aquaculture species. Therefore, this study employed a 2 × 3 experimental layout to investigate the effects of lupin meal (LM) protein inclusion levels (0, 25 and 75%) and organic selenium (OS) levels (0 or 2 g kg− 1) on the growth, physiology and histopathology of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer). The experimental diets (LM0, LM0 + OS, LM25, LM25 + OS, LM75 and LM75 + OS) were formulated on an isonitrogenous (48.8% crude protein) and isocalorific (20.6 MJ kg− 1 gross energy) basis. In the 60-day feeding experiment, final weight (FW), specific growth rate (SGR) and weight gain (WG) were improved by the supplementation of Se in LM-based diets. Fish fed diets containing Se had higher FW, SGR and WG compared with those fed diets lacking Se supplementation (P < 0.05). Both LM inclusion levels and Se supplementation levels affected the apparent digestibility coefficient of protein (ADC-P). Meanwhile, survival and the thermal growth coefficient (TGC) were not significantly different among all dietary treatments. The inclusion of a high LM level resulted in decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, but this effect was not observed when Se was supplemented in the diets. Furthermore, there was a linear relationship between muscle Se level and Se concentration of the experimental diets. Se-induced myopathy was observed in skeletal muscles of fish fed LM diets without Se supplementation. In addition, structural alteration was found in the liver; however, the kidney, spleen and intestine were histologically normal. Overall, these results suggest that high LM diets supplemented with organic selenium can enhance growth, physiological and histological performances of juvenile barramundi.

Statement of relevance

While plant-based feed sources such as lupin meal have the potential to reduce the reliance on unsustainable wild fishmeal in aquaculture, such products may reduce the feed availability of selenium, an essential element for aquatic animals. We believe that the findings of this study are relevant to the general field of commercial aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Effects of organic selenium supplementation on growth, glutathione peroxidase activity and histopathology in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer Bloch 1970) fed high lupin meal-based diets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Formalin (37–40% formaldehyde) is one of the most effective, widely used chemical in pisciculture for its antiparasitic, antifungal and prophylactic activities. It is used in paints, cleaning products and textile industry, as well. Genotoxic and histological effects of sublethal formalin exposure on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) are investigated in this study. The semi‐static acute test was employed. One‐tenth, one‐fifth and half of the 96‐h LC50 value, 148 mg L−1, were used as sublethal exposure concentrations: 15, 30 and 75 mg L−1 for 24, 48, 96 and 168 h respectively. The micronucleus test was applied to investigate the genotoxic effects on fish erythrocytes at the end of predetermined exposure periods and all tissues of the fish were sampled for histological examination. The micronucleus frequencies increased significantly in all exposure groups when compared with their control groups in a dose and time dependent manner (P < 0.05). Results of histological examination showed no histopathological findings in the gonads, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen and intestine tissues after sublethal formalin exposure. Passive hyperaemia of liver tissue in varying proportions, hydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration in high concentrations, branchitis on gill tissues in varying proportions, epithelial lifting, telangiectasia, bleeding in kidney and hyperaemia were found in Nile tilapia exposed to formalin at different concentrations and durations. As a result, it is thought that formalin leads to tissue damage and shows genotoxic effects even at 15 mg L−1 concentration in O. niloticus.

Fisheries management agencies allocate significant proportions of available resources to rear fish for stocking in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. However, domesticated fish reared in a hatchery environment may fail to exhibit normal antipredator behavior and can have relatively low survival when released into natural habitats. Exposing hatchery fish to natural predator cues can provide information about their capacity to exhibit appropriate behavioral responses and has the potential to enhance antipredator behavior and subsequent survival in the wild. We investigated immediate behavioral responses to an acute exposure to chemical cues of predation in highly domesticated, hatchery-reared rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. We used a frequently stocked and economically important strain of rainbow trout, the German Rainbow (GR), which is resistant to whirling disease but particularly susceptible to predation. We exposed individual rainbow trout to alarm cues from conspecifics, kairomones from brown trout Salmo trutta predators, and a combination of the two cues. Fish exposed to these cues exhibited changes in behavior expected to reduce predation risk, including a reduction in time spent actively swimming and exploring, and an increase in time spent frozen. Thus, these highly domesticated, hatchery-reared fish retain the innate ability to express appropriate responses to the threat of predation. Future research should investigate whether repeated exposure to predation cues in a hatchery setting could translate to long-term enhancement of antipredator behavior and increased survival rates, as this would provide a rapid, simple and low cost way to increase the efficiency of stocking programs for recreational purposes and, more importantly, native fish restoration and conservation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavioral responses of a highly domesticated, predator naïve rainbow trout to chemical cues of predation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article is concerned with how far-reaching economic and ecological changes are affecting the livelihoods of coastal households in Vietnam. In particular, we are interested in the livelihood effects of two aspects of this changing environment: (1) the transformation of the fisheries sector, including declining stocks and species loss and the rapid expansion of aquaculture, and (2) the broader structural change in the Vietnamese economy, from household-based primary-sector activities to wage and salary employment and self-employment outside the household. Our analysis, based on a survey of 599 households in 12 coastal communes in two provinces, shows considerable changes in livelihood patterns over the decade covered by the survey. Over one-third of the responding households reported a different primary earnings source in 2012 than in 2002. Fewer relied on aquaculture as their main livelihood activity in the later year. While aquaculture, encouraged by official policy, has assumed an increasingly dominant position in fish production in Vietnam then, this is not necessarily a shift that has worked to the benefit of households in the coastal communities we studied. For most, aquaculture has not generated very high incomes so some are making it a less important aspect of their livelihood portfolio, not dropping it completely but shifting productive efforts to other livelihoods. Meanwhile, economic growth and structural change have created new opportunities for wage employment and self-employment for growing numbers of households. However, human and financial capital are necessary conditions for taking advantage of such opportunities arising from Vietnam's economic development, which raises concerns about growing economic inequality in the country's coastal communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coastal livelihoods in transition: How are Vietnamese households responding to changes in the fisheries and in the economy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Mentoring has had a recent resurgence as the key to achieving both individual and organizational goals, especially as workforce diversification efforts have led to the hiring of new talent. Few studies have evaluated mentoring within an organization or examined changes in mentoring practices over time. We describe the role and status of mentoring for current fish biologists in the USDA Forest Service, including correlations between participation in mentoring and gender, race/ethnicity, career level, time in career, and job satisfaction based on a survey of agency employees (n = 136). Mentoring relates to a more than two‐fold increase in job satisfaction. Neither gender, race/ethnicity, career length, nor position are reliable predictors of whether someone has a mentor, evidence that participation in mentoring is consistent across the workforce and, at least superficially, it is equitable. Respondents sought guidance from mentors regarding technical skills, program management, communication, and leadership. Fish biologists of color were more likely than others to look for mentoring to build self‐confidence, address conflicts, and inform professional values and ethics. More early‐career fish biologist respondents identify as women in 2019 compared to a 1984 assessment. Overall, our results suggest that mentoring plays an important and positive role in career development and job satisfaction for fish biologists in the USDA Forest Service.

         Caviar consumption is increasing, and main projections indicate that the presumable maximum production will be of 3000 t year−1. From the productive point of view, the principal difference from the past caviar production is the definitive shift from wild to farmed caviar. Due to the recent advances in sturgeon aquaculture and the expansion of luxury consumers, there remains vast potential to reshape caviar consumption. Luxury market is extremely lucrative, it accounted for €217–€253 billion in 2016 and this is about 1.5 times of world aquaculture production. However, these perspectives are not only positive as this market segment is also affected by the diffusion of imitation (i.e. caviar substitutes, in this case). The proliferation of caviar substitutes can be interpreted as a kind of commercial Müllerian mimicry, while the adoption of new marketing strategy defined ‘Masstige’, which describes a downward luxury extensions directed towards middle‐class consumers and introduces new perspectives to this sector in its totality. What suggestions can be made by observing luxury consumers attitudes? This review takes into consideration the relation between sturgeon farming and quality of caviar on the light of modern societal changes. The main challenge for sturgeon aquaculture will be to spread a positive image of farmed caviar, thus introducing the aspects of excellence related to extensive aquaculture in controlled conditions by the adoption of shared rules on caviar quality. The most interesting aspects emerged are related to potential social expansion of caviar consumption, particularly in the middle‐class consumers.

         Environmental enrichment is the modification of otherwise sterile hatchery rearing units to provide structural complexity. We investigated the use of an array of suspended plastic conduit sections as enrichment in large circular tanks during two experiments. Brown Trout Salmo trutta and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were reared for 126 and 61 d, respectively, in covered, 3.63‐m‐diameter circular tanks that were either void of any structure or enriched with a suspended array of twenty 0.94‐m‐long sections of plastic conduit. Total tank weight gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved for both Brown Trout and Rainbow Trout reared with suspended conduit as enrichment compared to unenriched tanks. Enrichment did not significantly affect individual fish length, weight, or condition factor in either experiment, likely because of small sample sizes. The suspended array did not interfere with tank hydraulic self‐cleaning. Based on the results of this study, the use of vertically suspended enrichment structures in circular tanks is recommended to improve trout rearing efficiencies.

   ",,,,,,,,,,Aquaculture is a billion dollar industry and biofouling of aquaculture installations has heavy economic penalties. The natural antifouling (AF) defence mechanism of some seaweed that inhibits biofouling by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inspired us to mimic this process by fabricating ZnO photocatalytic nanocoating. AF activity of fishing nets modified with ZnO nanocoating was compared with uncoated nets (control) and nets painted with copper-based AF paint. One month experiment in tropical waters showed that nanocoatings reduce abundances of microfouling organisms by 3-fold compared to the control and had higher antifouling performance over AF paint. Metagenomic analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic fouling organisms using next generation sequencing platform proved that nanocoatings compared to AF paint were not selectively enriching communities with the resistant and pathogenic species. The proposed bio-inspired nanocoating is an important contribution towards environmentally friendly AF technologies for aquaculture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bioinspired nanocoatings for biofouling prevention by photocatalytic redox reactions,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the past changing trend of LULC along with modeling future LULC provides a combined opportunity to evaluate and guide the present and future land use policy. The southwest coastal region of Bangladesh, especially Assasuni Upazila of Satkhira District, is the most vulnerable to natural disasters and has faced notable changes in its LULC due to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic causes. The objectives of this study are to illustrate the temporal dynamics of LULC change in Assasuni Upazila over the last 27 years (i.e., between 1989 and 2015) and also to predict future land use change using CA-ANN (cellular automata and artificial neural network) model for the year 2028. Temporal dynamics of LULC change was analyzed, employing supervised classification of multi-temporal Landsat images. Then, prediction of future LULC was carried out by CA-ANN model using MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS. The analysis of LULC change revealed that the LULC of Assasuni had changed notably during 1989 to 2015. “Bare lands” decreased by 21% being occupied by other land uses, especially by “shrimp farms.” Shrimp farm area increased by 25.9% during this period, indicating a major occupational transformation from agriculture to shrimp aquaculture in the study area during the period under study. Reduction in “settlement” area revealed the trend of migration from the Upazila. The predicted LULC for the year 2028 showed that reduction in bare land area would continue and 1595.97 ha bare land would transform into shrimp farm during 2015 to 2028. Also, the impacts of the changing LULC on the livelihood of local people and migration status of the Upazila were analyzed from the data collected through focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys. The analysis revealed that the changing LULC and the occupational shift from paddy cultivation to shrimp farming were related to each other. Around 31.3% of the total respondents stated that at least one of their family members had migrated. Climate-driven southwestern coastal people usually migrate from the vulnerable rural areas towards the nearest relatively safe city due to adverse effects of natural disasters. To control the unplanned development and reduce the internal migration in Assasuni and other coastal areas, a comprehensive land use management plan was suggested that would accommodate the diversified uses of coastal lands and eventually lessen the threats to the life and livelihood of the local people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Temporal dynamics of land use/land cover change and its prediction using CA-ANN model for southwestern coastal Bangladesh,,,,,,,,,,

   ",,,,,,,,,,"The mass release of hatchery-propagated stocks raises numerous questions concerning its efficiency in terms of local recruitment and effect on the genetic diversity of wild populations. A seeding program, consisting of mass release of hatchery-produced juveniles in the local naturally occurring population of great scallops (Pecten maximus L.), was initiated in the early 1980s in the Bay of Brest (France). The present study aims at evaluating whether this seeding program leads to actual population enhancement, with detectable effects on genetic diversity and effective population size, or consists of sea ranching with limited genetic consequences on the wild stock. To address this question, microsatellite-based genetic monitoring of three hatchery-born and naturally recruited populations was conducted over a 5-year period. Results showed a limited reduction in allelic richness but a strong alteration of allelic frequencies in hatchery populations, while genetic diversity appeared very stable over time in the wild populations. A temporal increase in relatedness was observed in both cultured stock and wild populations. Effective population size (Ne) estimates were low and variable in the wild population. Moreover, the application of the Ryman-Laikre model suggested a high contribution of hatchery-born scallops to the reproductive output of the wild population. Overall, the data suggest that the main objective of the seeding program, which is stock enhancement, is fulfilled. Moreover, gene flow from surrounding populations and/or the reproductive input of undetected sub-populations within the bay may buffer the Ryman-Laikre effect and ensure the retention of the local genetic variability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stock enhancement or sea ranching?

"Abstract

Studies of commercial fishing have shown that it is a hazardous occupation with high rates of injury and fatal accidents. Research has also identified a range of other health risks faced by fishers, yet the general health outcomes of fishers have not been compared to those of workers in other industries. This study aimed to assess self-reported health outcomes among workers in the fishing industry, and to compare this to those working in other industries. Drawing on 2011 census data for England and Wales we used generalised linear models to compare self-reported measures of 1) general health and 2) limiting long-term illness across industry categories, calculating odds ratios adjusted for age, geographic region and socio-economic profile of local authorities. Of the population working in 87 industry classes, those in category ‘03 Fishing and aquaculture’ had the fifth highest rate of poor general health (2.8% reported ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ health) and the sixth highest rate of reporting limiting long-term illness (10.3% reported their activities to be limited ‘a lot’ or ‘a little’). Odds ratios adjusted for age, geographic region and socio-economic profile of local authorities showed that only two other industries demonstrated statistical evidence for higher odds of poor general health or limiting long-term illness than workers in fishing and aquaculture. This study demonstrates that fishing is among the industries with the poorest general health and limiting long-term illness outcomes in the UK, demonstrating the need for tailored occupational health services to support UK fishing communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The health of commercial fishers in England and Wales: Analysis of the 2011 census,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sudden disruptions, or shocks, to food production can adversely impact access to and trade of food commodities. Seafood is the most traded food commodity and is globally important to human nutrition.

      Abstract
      
         Resource allocation for fisheries management and conservation in the United States has not grown substantially in recent years, and there is ongoing debate over how limited resources should be used to create, maintain, or restore fisheries. Hatcheries have been in existence in North America since 1848, but their organization and role in fisheries management are not widely understood or appreciated. The continuing debate about hatcheries has painted them in broad strokes, with critics suggesting that hatcheries are altogether ineffective, unnecessary, too costly to operate, or do more harm than good to wild populations. Such characterizations fail to capture the diversity of hatchery operations and do not acknowledge the hatchery reform initiatives of the past 20 years or public expectations and legal requirements that influence the production and use of hatchery‐origin fish. In this paper, we describe the current number and distribution of fish hatcheries operated for public purposes in North America, provide insights on the costs and benefits of hatcheries operated for public use and other public trust purposes, provide initial cost comparisons to habitat rehabilitation or restoration, and consider the role of hatcheries into the future as a fisheries management tool.

        The fishery sub-sector is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Uganda’s economy (estimated at US$ 135 million) after coffee. However, declining trends in annual fish production are a real threat in terms of the loss of potential foreign exchange earnings, household income and food security. This study demonstrates that favourable international fish prices have supported steady foreign exchange earnings in Uganda amidst declining fish volumes. To enable Uganda to take advantage of this opportunity, innovations capable of overcoming supply-side constraints will play a critical role. We find that aquaculture has tremendous potential to stir growth of the fishery industry as well as generate employment. The results demonstrate that innovative technology such as floating cage culture is a more productive system in comparison to capture fishery - a farmer using floating cage technology produces 12 times more tonnage per annum than his or her counterparts practising capture fishery. Therefore, to increase fish production, adoption of cage farming technology must be expanded. We identified policy gaps that delimit the development of aquaculture in Uganda, which must be remedied. Policy lessons are drawn from China and Egypt – with the most successful stories in aquaculture technology and support services, which enormously increased fish farming productivity and exports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

The metagenomic analysis showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes were the top five phyla identified from all samples. The aquaculture production system significantly changed the structure of aquatic microbial populations. Substantial changes were also observed in SNP patterns among four sample types. The gene-specific sweep was found to be more common than genome-wide sweep. The selective sweep analysis revealed that 21 antibiotic resistant (AR) genes were under selection, with most belonging to antibiotic efflux pathways. Over 200 AR gene gains and losses were determined by changes in gene frequencies. Most of the AR genes were characterized as ABC efflux pumps, RND efflux pumps, and tetracycline MFS efflux pumps. Results of this study suggested that aquaculture waste, especially waste containing therapeutic antibiotics, has a significant impact on microbial population structures and their genetic structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic adaptation of microbial populations present in high-intensity catfish production systems with therapeutic oxytetracycline treatment,,,,,,,,,,

Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) has been an important source of income for communities in the Madre de Dios River Basin in Peru for hundreds of years. However, in recent decades, the scale of ASGM activities in the region has increased dramatically, and exposures to a variety of occupational and environmental hazards related to ASGM, including mercury, are becoming more widespread. The aims of our study were to: (1) examine patterns in the total hair mercury level of human participants in several communities in the region and compare these results to the 2.2 µg/g total hair mercury level equivalent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee of Food Additives (JECFA)’s Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI); and (2), to measure the mercury levels of paco (Piaractus brachypomus) fish raised in local aquaculture ponds, in order to compare these levels to the EPA Fish Tissue Residue Criterion of 0.3 µg Hg/g fish (wet weight). We collected hair samples from 80 participants in four communities (one control and three where ASGM activities occurred) in the region, and collected 111 samples from fish raised in 24 local aquaculture farms. We then analyzed the samples for total mercury. Total mercury levels in hair were statistically significantly higher in the mining communities than in the control community, and increased with increasing geodesic distance from the Madre de Dios headwaters, did not differ by sex, and frequently exceeded the reference level. Regression analyses indicated that higher hair mercury levels were associated with residence in ASGM communities. The analysis of paco fish samples found no samples that exceeded the EPA tissue residue criterion. Collectively, these results align with other recent studies showing that ASGM activities are associated with elevated human mercury exposure. The fish farmed through the relatively new process of aquaculture in ASGM areas appeared to have little potential to contribute to human mercury exposure. More research is needed on human health risks associated with ASGM to discern occupational, residential, and nutritional exposure, especially through tracking temporal changes in mercury levels as fish ponds age, and assessing levels in different farmed fish species. Additionally, research is needed to definitively determine that elevated mercury levels in humans and fish result from the elemental mercury from mining, rather than from a different source, such as the mercury released from soil erosion during deforestation events from mining or other activities.

Information and communication and technologies (ICTs) have contributed to national development in recent years. However, less is known on how ICT could help improve productivity in the aquaculture field. This study investigates how the use of the Internet can help improve fish farms' productivity. More speciﬁcally, using survey data from two regions in Ghana and the econometric model approach, this study explored the quantitative impacts of Internet use on fish farm productivity. The results are as follows. First, the study revealed that Internet use is affected by household total land holdings, access to credit and off-farm employment, education, being a member of an association and how household perceives the use of the internet and household head age. Second, regarding the quantitative relationship, Internet use can help increase farm productivity. Compared with males, the impact of female heads’ Internet use on farm productivity is more prominent. Finally, the productivity effect of Internet use for farmers with no access to off-farm work is greater than that for those with off-farm work access.

"Abstract

Information and communication and technologies (ICTs) have contributed to national development in recent years. However, less is known on how ICT could help improve productivity in the aquaculture field. This study investigates how the use of the Internet can help improve fish farms' productivity. More speciﬁcally, using survey data from two regions in Ghana and the econometric model approach, this study explored the quantitative impacts of Internet use on fish farm productivity. The results are as follows. First, the study revealed that Internet use is affected by household total land holdings, access to credit and off-farm employment, education, being a member of an association and how household perceives the use of the internet and household head age. Second, regarding the quantitative relationship, Internet use can help increase farm productivity. Compared with males, the impact of female heads’ Internet use on farm productivity is more prominent. Finally, the productivity effect of Internet use for farmers with no access to off-farm work is greater than that for those with off-farm work access. Our findings provide policy implications to improve farm household Internet use and fish farms production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The human population is growing and, globally, we must meet the challenge of increased protein needs required to feed this population. Single cell proteins (SCP), when coupled to aquaculture production, offer a means to ensure future protein needs can be met without direct competition with food for people. To demonstrate a given type of SCP has potential as a protein source for use in aquaculture feed, a number of steps need to be validated including demonstrating that the SCP is accepted by the species in question, leads to equivalent survival and growth, does not result in illness or other maladies, is palatable to the consumer, is cost effective to produce and can easily be incorporated into diets using existing technology. Here we examine white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) growth and consumer taste preference, smallmouth grunt (Haemulon chrysargyreum) growth, survival, health and gut microbiota, and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) digestibility when fed diets that substitute the bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens at a level of 30% (grunts), 100% (shrimp), or 55% (salmon) of the fishmeal in a compound feed. In each of these tests, animals performed equivalently when fed diets containing M. extorquens as when fed a standard aquaculture diet. This transdisciplinary approach is a first validation of this bacterium as a potential SCP protein substitute in aquafeeds. Given the ease to produce this SCP through an aerobic fermentation process, the broad applicability for use in aquaculture indicates the promise of M. extorquens in leading toward greater food security in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A transdisciplinary approach to the initial validation of a single cell protein as an alternative protein source for use in aquafeeds

         Seahorse aquaculture has been a focus for meeting the demand of traditional medicine and aquarium. Feeble (poor quality) juveniles are commonly found in the commercial seahorse culture. In this study, we compared the growth and survival performances of the feeble and healthy common seahorses Hippocampus kuda. The results show that the feeble juveniles had high growth and survival at the temperature of 27–29 C and salinity of 26–28‰ with frequent feeding (≥three times a day) during first 5 wk. Through a 12‐wk investigation, we found that the air‐bubble disease could significantly affect the specific growth rate and survival of the feeble juveniles. There was a positive and significant correlation between the substrate‐attachment rate and survival rate in the feeble juveniles, and substrate‐attachment rate may be used to assess the quality of the feeble populations in the seahorse H. kuda.

Blue Growth is the creation of economic activity and jobs at sea, while multiple use of space makes efficient use of the available sea area by combining industries. Clearly there are many combinations and many value propositions. However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability.

The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination.

The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors.

In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation. The macro and micro assessment methods will be particularly useful in other Blue Economy contexts and in other multiple product contexts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Feasibility of investment in Blue Growth multiple-use of space and multi-use platform projects; results of a novel assessment approach and case studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract
Background

Aquaculture represents a solution to the future world demand for healthy protein while challenges that require urgent solutions are emerging in feed production, such as the rising costs of feed protein and massive imports. From a European perspective, a large proportion of the protein demand is met with imported protein. This article will focus on the development of protein-rich microorganisms (i.e. Single cell protein) as a novel raw material in fish feed which can be produced as an important co-product in wood-based biorefineries, increasing sustainability and the utilization of organic waste material.

Scope and Approach

Developing a safe and sustainable protein resource from local organic waste-material represents an opportunity for Europe to decrease its reliance on nutritional imports, and address mounting food sector sustainability concerns and a growing protein deficit. At the same time, the nutrient recycling industry represents a growing industry, addressing waste valorization and protein feed production concerns at once.

Key Findings and Conclusion

An industry and research collaboration has focused on selecting which microorganisms and residual streams from a wood-biorefinery site that would be best suited for production of SCP. The study showed that 38–68% of the fishmeal in a Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) feed could be replaced with SCP while maintaining a similar or slightly improved fish growth. As reported by FAO, aquaculture production of Nile tilapia in 2014 was 3.7 million tonnes, making it one of the most produced fish species in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Safe and sustainable protein sources from the forest industry – The case of fish feed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The demand for animal protein, especially fish, is growing fast, perhaps due to the rapid expansion of populations, increases in income and changes in eating habits and life styles. Capture fisheries, which supply over 70% of the fish for human consumption in Malaysia, are over-exploited or depleted. Their yields have become stagnant over the last few decades and in some cases have even declined. Nevertheless, aquaculture has the potential to meet these challenges if practised well. This study therefore aims to estimate the technical efficiency of pond culture systems using data envelopment analysis (DEA). In addition, it investigates the determinants of technical efficiency by employing an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. The estimated technical efficiency of pond culture was found to be 0.86, which means that the fish farmers in our sample could reach full technical efficiency through reducing their input usage by 14% with the current level of technology to produce the same output levels. The results of the OLS regression indicate that farmers’ age, experience, extension training and water management have positive and statistically significant impacts on technical efficiency. Information on water management practices could be passed on by extension agents to inefficient farms to assist them in catching up with the farms demonstrating best practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evaluating contextual factors affecting the technical efficiency of freshwater pond culture systems in Peninsular Malaysia: A two-stage DEA approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshwater prawns are excellent options for integration, since they are omnivores and can therefore take advantage of a wide range of feed residuals, either from aquatic or terrestrial species. Furthermore, due to their benthic habit, they have a well-defined spatial distribution in the environment, thus favoring interaction with various species of fish, other animals, and even with plants. The integrated farming of freshwater prawns includes different culture systems, such as polyculture and coculture with other aquatic species, rice-prawn culture, hydroponics, and integration with terrestrial animals and plants. Our review includes a worldwide perspective on the main commercial integrated systems involving freshwater prawns, the present status of research on integrated freshwater prawn production and the main opportunities for integrated freshwater prawn farming in a world that is moving toward sustainability. The review continues by providing a brief summary of the future prospects for this form of aquaculture. Finally, we conclude that integrating freshwater prawn farming with other aquaculture and farming activities has considerable potential as a means of increasing food production in a sustainable fashion.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Integrated Freshwater Prawn Farming: State-of-the-Art and Future Potential,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study provides information on current antibiotic use in freshwater aquaculture, as well as on resulting antibiotic concentrations in the aquatic environment of the Mekong Delta. Two major production steps, fish hatcheries and mature fish cultivation, were surveyed (50 fish farm interviews) for antibiotic use. Different water sources, including surface water, groundwater and piped water (164 water samples) were systematically screened for antibiotic residues. To better understand antibiotic fate under tropical conditions, the dissipation behavior of selected antibiotics in the aquatic environment was investigated for the first time in mesocosm experiments. None of the investigated antibiotics were detected in groundwater and piped water samples. Surface water, which is still often used for drinking and domestic purposes by local populations, contained median concentrations of 21 ng L-1 sulfamethoxazole (SMX), 4 ng L-1 sulfadiazine (SDZ), 17 ng L-1 trimethoprim (TRIM), and 12 ng L-1 enrofloxacin (ENRO). These concentrations were lower than the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), suggesting limited antibiotic-related risk to aquatic ecosystems in the monitored systems. The dissipation half-lives of the studied antibiotics ranged from <1 to 44 days, depending on the availability of sunlight and sediment. Among the studied antibiotics TRIM was the most persistent in water systems. TRIM was not susceptible to photodegradation, while the dissipation of ENRO and SDZ was influenced by photolysis. The recorded dissipation models gave good predictions of the occurrence and concentrations of TRIM, ENRO and SDZ in surface water. In summary, the currently measured concentrations of the investigated antibiotics are unlikely to cause immediate risks to the aquatic environment, yet the persistence of these antibiotics is of concern and might lead to chronic exposure of aquatic organisms as well as humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Occurrence and Dissipation of the Antibiotics Sulfamethoxazole, Sulfadiazine, Trimethoprim, and Enrofloxacin in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam",,,,,,,,

We showed that hypoxia and air exposure conditions induced a significant reduction in the early innate immune response (lysozyme activity, interferon-induced-GTP-binding protein-Mx1 [mx], interleukin-1β [il1β], serum amyloid-A [saa]), and a substantial increase in cortisol, heat shock protein (Hsp70), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), superoxide dismutase (Sod1) that associated with a decline in insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1). Mixed Bacillus species administration improved the early innate responses, reduced cortisol, Hsp70, Gpx and Sod1, and elevated Igf1 levels. Bacillus species treated group showed faster recovery to reach the baseline levels during 24 h compared to untreated group. Therefore, mixed Bacillus species may enhance yellow perch welfare by improving the stress tolerance and early innate immune response to counterbalance the various husbandry stressors.

         The US regulatory environment has been characterized as complex due to the greater than 1300 laws promulgated at local, state, and federal levels. Recent declines in the growth rate of US aquaculture have been attributed, in part, to a complex, overlapping, and inefficient regulatory framework. This study is the first to examine this question by quantifying the farm‐level regulatory burden and its economic effects in an aquaculture industry sector. A survey was conducted of baitfish and sportfish producers in the 13 major production states in the USA to identify the direct and indirect costs of regulation on producers. Survey responses captured 74% of the national volume of baitfish and sportfish production. The data revealed that only 1% of total regulatory costs are direct costs of regulation, such as license and permit fees, while 99% of the costs are due to manpower used for compliance, farm changes to remain in compliance, and sales lost without replacement. Costs due to regulations varied across states and farm sizes. Across all respondents, average total regulatory costs were found to be $148,554/farm, or $7383/ha. The farm‐level cost to the US baitfish and sportfish industry was estimated to be in excess of $12 million. On 38% of the farms, the cost of regulations exceeded the value of profits on baitfish and sportfish farms. Our findings confirm previous reports of the complexity of the regulatory environment. Results show that the total regulatory burden has increased farm‐level costs and restricted access to markets, thereby reducing profitability and contributing to reduced growth of the US baitfish and sportfish industry.

Antimicrobial contamination in aquaculture products constitutes a food safety hazard, but little is known about the introduction and accumulation of antimicrobials in integrated fish-pig aquaculture. This study, conducted in 2013, aimed to determine the residues of 11 types of antimicrobials by UPLC-MS/MS analysis in fish feed (n = 37), pig feed (n = 9), pig manure (n = 9), pond sediment (n = 20), fish skin (n = 20) and muscle tissue (n = 20) sampled from integrated tilapia-pig farms, non-integrated tilapia farms and fish feed supply shops. There was a higher occurrence of antimicrobial residues in fish skin from both integrated and non-integrated farms, and in pig manure. Enrofloxacin (3.9–129.3 μg/kg) and sulfadiazine (0.7–7.8 μg/kg) were commonly detected in fish skin and muscle, pig manure and pond sediment from integrated farms, with different types of antimicrobials found in pig manure and tilapia samples. In non-integrated farms, sulfadiazine (2.5–89.9 μg/kg) was the predominant antimicrobial detected in fish skin and muscle, fish feed and pond sediment. In general, antimicrobials seemed not to be commonly transmitted from pig to fish in tilapia-pig integrated farms, and fish feed, pig feed and pond sediment did not seem as important sources of the antimicrobials found in fish from both systems. The frequent findings of antimicrobial residues in fish skin compared with fish muscle was probably due to different pharmacokinetics in different tissue types, which have practical food safety implications since antimicrobial residues monitoring is usually performed analyzing mixed skin and fish muscle samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sources and fate of antimicrobials in integrated fish-pig and non-integrated tilapia farms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Natural resource professionals have frequently criticized universities for poorly preparing graduates to succeed in their jobs. We surveyed members of the American Fisheries Society to determine which job skills and knowledge of academic topics employers, students, and university faculty members deemed most important to early‐career success of fisheries professionals. Respondents also rated proficiency of recently hired, entry‐level professionals (employers) on how well their programs prepared them for career success (students and faculty) in those same job skills and academic topics. Critical thinking and written and oral communication skills topped the list of important skills and academic topics. Employers perceived recent entry‐level hires to be less well‐prepared to succeed in their careers than either university faculty or students. Entry‐level hires with post‐graduate degrees rated higher in proficiency for highly important skills and knowledge than those with bachelor's degrees. We conclude that although universities have the primary responsibility for developing critical thinking and basic communication skills of students, employers have equal or greater responsibility for enhancing skills of employees in teamwork, field techniques, and communicating with stakeholders. The American Fisheries Society can significantly contribute to the preparation of young fisheries professionals by providing opportunities for continuing education and networking with peers at professional conferences.

      Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV‐3) is the aetiological agent of a serious infective, notifiable disease affecting common carp and varieties. In survivors, infection is generally characterized by a subclinical latency phase with restricted viral replication. The CyHV‐3 genome is difficult to detect in such carrier fish that represent a potential source of dissemination if viral reactivation occurs. In this study, the analytical and diagnostic performance of an alternative serum neutralization (SN) method based on the detection of CyHV‐3‐specific antibodies was assessed using 151 serum or plasma samples from healthy and naturally or experimentally CyHV‐3‐infected carp. French CyHV‐3 isolate 07/108b was neutralized efficiently by sera from carp infected with European, American and Taiwanese CyHV‐3 isolates, but no neutralization was observed using sera specific to other aquatic herpesviruses. Diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity and repeatability of 95.9%, 99.0% and 99.3%, respectively, were obtained, as well as a compliance rate of 89.9% in reproducibility testing. Neutralizing antibodies were steadily detected in infected carp subjected to restrictive or permissive temperature variations over more than 25 months post‐infection. The results suggest that this non‐lethal diagnostic test could be used in the future to improve the epidemiological surveillance and control of CyHV‐3 disease.

   Abstract
   
      
      Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV‐3) is the aetiological agent of a serious infective, notifiable disease affecting common carp and varieties. In survivors, infection is generally characterized by a subclinical latency phase with restricted viral replication. The CyHV‐3 genome is difficult to detect in such carrier fish that represent a potential source of dissemination if viral reactivation occurs. In this study, the analytical and diagnostic performance of an alternative serum neutralization (SN) method based on the detection of CyHV‐3‐specific antibodies was assessed using 151 serum or plasma samples from healthy and naturally or experimentally CyHV‐3‐infected carp. French CyHV‐3 isolate 07/108b was neutralized efficiently by sera from carp infected with European, American and Taiwanese CyHV‐3 isolates, but no neutralization was observed using sera specific to other aquatic herpesviruses. Diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity and repeatability of 95.9%, 99.0% and 99.3%, respectively, were obtained, as well as a compliance rate of 89.9% in reproducibility testing. Neutralizing antibodies were steadily detected in infected carp subjected to restrictive or permissive temperature variations over more than 25 months post‐infection. The results suggest that this non‐lethal diagnostic test could be used in the future to improve the epidemiological surveillance and control of CyHV‐3 disease.
      
   
",,,,,,,,,,"Stocking of hatchery produced fish is common practise to mitigate declines in natural populations and may have unwanted genetic consequences. Here we describe a novel phenomenon arising where broodstock used for stocking may be introgressed with farmed individuals. We test how stocking affects introgression in a wild population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by quantifying how the number of adult offspring recaptured in a stocked river depend on parental introgression. We found that hatchery conditions favour farmed genotypes such that introgressed broodstock produce up to four times the number of adult offspring compared to non-introgressed broodstock, leading to increased introgression in the recipient spawning population. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that stocking can unintentionally favour introgressed individuals and through selection for domesticated genotypes compromise the fitness of stocked wild populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Supplementary stocking selects for domesticated genotypes,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The aim of this study was to develop and test the feasibility of a concept called Internet of Fish (IoF). State-of-the-art acoustic telemetry systems could enable farmers to acquire behavioural data of fish in fish farms, however, the existing systems provide limited real-time access to the telemetry data. Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are instrumental in the proliferation of the Internet of Things and enables spatially dispersed devices to communicate over long distances for months using dedicated modulations schemes. The IoF concept exploits the harmony in the performance characteristics of acoustic fish telemetry and LoRa (Long Range wireless data protocol with low power modulation) based LPWAN to provide real-time access to the telemetry data. This was achieved by developing a device designated as the LoRa Add-on Module (LAM), which provides LoRa radio support to underwater acoustic receivers. In this study, feasibility of the IoF concept was tested by conducting an experiment in a commercial marine fish farm in Norway. Four LAM and acoustic receiver pairs with a link-length to a centralized gateway of 150 m to 2.5 km were used in the field experiment. The Quality of Service (QoS) of the proposed LoRa LPWAN was determined to evaluate the effect of link-length. The QoS of more than 90% was achieved for all nodes, affirming the feasibility of real-time monitoring in marine fish farms and exposed aquaculture sites based on the IoF concept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Internet of Fish: Integration of acoustic telemetry with LPWAN for efficient real-time monitoring of fish in marine farms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         This study was carried out to investigate the effect of water‐soluble polysaccharides extract of algae Ulva rigida (WPU) as dietary supplement on growth performance, antioxidant enzyme activity, lysozyme and phenoloxidase activity, and resistance of shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) subjected to bacterial infection with Photobacterium damselae. Three replicate groups of shrimp (1.0 g) were fed four diets containing four levels, 0 or control, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 g/kg of WPU for 8 weeks over the growth trial. Thereafter, 30 shrimps from each dietary treatment were infected with bacteria P. damselae to evaluate disease resistance of infected shrimp. The results of this study showed that WPU was effective as a growth promoter for L. vannamei. The best growth rate was observed in shrimp fed 1.5 g/kg of WPU diet. Regarding antioxidant defences, the diets supplemented with three levels of WPU stimulated glutathione peroxidase and catalase activates in experimental shrimps. MDA content of L. vannamei‐fed diet containing WPU 1.5 and WPU 1.0 was lower than WPU 0 and WPU 0. 5 diets. Also, lysozyme and phenoloxidase activities of shrimp receiving WPU at 1.0 and 1.5 level were significantly higher than those fed WPU 0 and WPU 0.5 diets. In addition, using WPU extract in all diets decreased mortality in L. vannamei in a dose‐dependent manner after challenge with P. damselae. These results suggest that incorporation of water‐soluble polysaccharides from green algae U. rigida at 1.5 g/kg doses improves growth and antioxidant activity and enhances the immune responses in shrimp L. vannamei.

Multiple organs, especially the liver, are considerably affected by Cd in both humans and animals. We investigated the protective effects of metallothionein (MT) and vitamin E (VE) supplementation on Cd-induced apoptosis in the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) liver. Grass carp were divided into four groups: the control group, Cd + phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group, Cd + VE group, and Cd + MT group. All fish were injected with CdCl2 on the first day and then VE, MT, and PBS were given 4 days postinjection, respectively. The results showed that Cd administration resulted in liver poisoning in grass carp, which was expressed as an increase in Cd contents, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, percentage of hepatocyte apoptosis, and apoptosis-related gene mRNA transcript expression. However, VE and MT treatments protected against Cd-induced hepatotoxicity in grass carp by decreasing Cd contents, lipid peroxidation, and histological damage and reducing the percentage of hepatocyte apoptosis by regulating related mRNA transcript expression. These data demonstrate that oxidative stress and activation of the caspase signaling cascade play a critical role in Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. However, VE and MT alleviate Cd-induced hepatotoxicity through their antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects, and MT has a more powerful effect than VE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hepatoprotective Activity of Vitamin E and Metallothionein in Cadmium-Induced Liver Injury in Ctenopharyngodon idellus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

Two case studies from Southeast Asia are used to analyse production, environmental effects, and economic optimisation of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) pond culture. A projection of these data is made for the whole of Thailand. The results are analysed on a regional scale based on site selection using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE).

Farm-scale culture was simulated for (i) tilapia monoculture in Chiang Rai; (ii) shrimp monoculture in Chanthaburi; and (iii) Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) of tilapia and shrimp in Chon Buri. Together, these provinces produced 17,500 tonnes of tilapia in 2012, with a significant proportion exported to North America and Europe.

Growth models for both species were developed, calibrated, and validated, and used to simulate population dynamics of cultivated animals, and sediment diagenesis and eutrophication in ponds. Co-cultivation stimulates nitrogen dissolution (134 kg N cycle− 1), which is greater than in tilapia (96 kg N) or shrimp (52 kg N) monoculture, and doubles the NH4+ discharge to the environment (10.7 kg in tilapia monoculture, 20.5 kg in co-cultivation). However, eutrophication as a result of shrimp monoculture decreases sharplychlorophyll emissions fall from 0.17 kg to 0.02 kg. A modelled IMTA scenario including the green seaweed Ulva reduced NH4+ outflow to 0.32 kg cycle− 1.

Scaling to the national level, for a 2010 production of 158,293 t y− 1 (tilapia), and 553,899 t y− 1 (shrimp), gives calculated emissions of 2,105,118 and 34,904 Population Equivalents (PEQ) respectively. Only part is a negative externality, because rural agro-aqua systems in Thailand reuse discharges in holding ponds, rice culture, etc.

Commercial tilapia and shrimp aquaculture have a value added share of total GDP of 0.38, and value added of 96.24, resulting in indirect impacts of the industry on the Thai economy of $35 million, and the creation of 16,000 additional jobs.

The MCE scenario analysis suggests sustainable expansion is possible for both species. The highly suitable class for tilapia would triple in the dry season, but halve in the rainy season. For shrimp the corresponding areas would decrease in both seasons. However, the suitable class is two orders of magnitude greater than the current level of tilapia farming, and shrimp could increase tenfold (limited by the rainy season due to low salinity). These projections which are constrained by competing land claims, will be further influenced by socio-economic factors, and would depend upon national or regional policy decisions.

These models, together with economic indicators developed for the aquaculture industry in Thailand, provide an overview of this important contributor to world aquaculture, which has a volume production greater than both the US and EU, and explore some of the lessons that may be learnt worldwide at both the local and national scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analysis of production and environmental effects of Nile tilapia and white shrimp culture in Thailand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increases to the seaweed communities and reduced fishing efforts were the primary factors associated with the wild population recovery; effects of aquaculture were much smaller.

         Elevated concentrations of CO2 in seawater can disrupt numerous sensory systems in marine fish. This is of particular concern for Pacific salmon because they rely on olfaction during all aspects of their life including during their homing migrations from the ocean back to their natal streams. We investigated the effects of elevated seawater CO2 on coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) olfactory‐mediated behavior, neural signaling, and gene expression within the peripheral and central olfactory system. Ocean‐phase coho salmon were exposed to three levels of CO2, ranging from those currently found in ambient marine water to projected future levels. Juvenile coho salmon exposed to elevated CO2 levels for 2 weeks no longer avoided a skin extract odor that elicited avoidance responses in coho salmon maintained in ambient CO2 seawater. Exposure to these elevated CO2 levels did not alter odor signaling in the olfactory epithelium, but did induce significant changes in signaling within the olfactory bulb. RNA‐Seq analysis of olfactory tissues revealed extensive disruption in expression of genes involved in neuronal signaling within the olfactory bulb of salmon exposed to elevated CO2, with lesser impacts on gene expression in the olfactory rosettes. The disruption in olfactory bulb gene pathways included genes associated with GABA signaling and maintenance of ion balance within bulbar neurons. Our results indicate that ocean‐phase coho salmon exposed to elevated CO2 can experience significant behavioral impairments likely driven by alteration in higher‐order neural signal processing within the olfactory bulb. Our study demonstrates that anadromous fish such as salmon may share a sensitivity to rising CO2 levels with obligate marine species suggesting a more wide‐scale ecological impact of ocean acidification.

      The short‐snouted seahorse (Hippocampus hippocampus) is a benthic fish that bases its survival on camouflage with the environment; therefore, both in wild and in captivity specimens, differences in coloration have been observed. This study was conducted to study the effect of five different diets, based on Artemia and frozen mysis, on fish survival, growth, skin colour parameters and biochemical composition. After 102 days of feeding different diets, no effect was observed on fish survival, growth, protein, ash or humidity content, except for colour changes on yellow and red fish. Differences on seahorse lipid and total carotenoids content were obtained in the experiment because of experimental diets. Fish eating Artemia showed the highest colour pattern response during the trial, with a maximum yellowness attained of 21. Additionally, a plateau of the skin colour expression for Artemia‐feeding fish was reached on day 180. A reversion of the yellowish skin colour was determined after a change of diet.

Vaccination is one of the most effective disease control strategies that has contributed to the significant reduction of disease outbreaks and antibiotics usage in salmonid aquaculture. To date, licensing of fish vaccines is to a limited extent based on in vitro correlates of protection, as done for many mammalian vaccines. This is because the immunological mechanisms of vaccine protection have not been clearly elucidated for most fish vaccines. Herein, we provide an overview of the different steps required to establish correlates of protective immunity required to serve as benchmarks in optimizing vaccine production in aquaculture. We highlight the importance of optimizing challenge models needed to generate consistent results used during vaccine development as a basis for establishing immune correlates of protection. Data generated this far shows that antibodies are potentially the most reliable correlates of protective immunity for fish vaccines. Our findings also show that antigen dose can be optimized to serve as a correlate of protection for fish vaccines. Further, there is need to establish signatures of T-cell protective immunity when antibodies fail to serve as proxies of immune protection, particularly for vaccines against intracellular pathogens. We can anticipate that documentation of efficacy for future vaccines in aquaculture, particularly batch testing will be based on in vitro correlates of protective immunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Correlates of protective immunity for fish vaccines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Commercially selective breeding of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) primarily for rapid growth may compromise cardiorespiratory robustness and its related phenotypes. Therefore, a suite of respiratory indices was used to evaluate aerobic capacity and hypoxia tolerance to test the hypothesis that exercise training can improve the athletic robustness in both domesticated and wild strains of Atlantic salmon, but with the domesticated strain having a less cardiorespiratory plasticity and a lower athletic robustness than the wild strain. We also tested a second hypothesis that a constant acceleration screening protocol should segregate fish according to athletic robustness based on their swimming ability. These hypotheses were tested with parr from Bolaks (domesticated) and Lærdal (wild) strains of Atlantic salmon that were reared under identical hatchery conditions. After screening into either inferior (bottom 20%) or superior (top 20%) swimmers, the four groups of fish (two strains and two swimming performance levels) either were given an 18-day exercise-training regime (an incremental water current of 2.0–2.8 fork lengths s− 1), or were maintained at the control water current (0.5 fork lengths s− 1) for 18 days. Subsequently, fish were sampled for metabolic enzyme analysis in red and white swimming muscles (citrate synthase, CS, and lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; n = 15 from each group) and their individual respiratory capacities were comprehensively assessed by measuring the standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum rate of oxygen uptake (ṀO2max), absolute aerobic scope (AAS), factorial aerobic scope (FAS), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), critical oxygen level (O2crit) and incipient lethal oxygen saturation (ILOS). Contrary to our expectations, the inferior and superior swimmers were indistinguishable in either strain and these data were pooled. While exercise training produced several tangible benefits for the wild fish, it produced very few for the domesticated fish. For example, the wild strain, but not the domesticated strain, had a significantly higher ṀO2max, AAS and EPOC as a result of training. Also, CS activity in red muscle increased after training to a larger extent in the wild strain than in the domesticated strain. When compared with the wild strain, the domesticated strain had a significantly lower ṀO2max, AAS, FAS and CS activity in white muscle. Thus, the domesticated strain appeared to be athletically less robust than the wild strain. These results imply that approximately ten generations of selective breeding for rapid growth in commercial aquaculture have reduced the overall athletic robustness of domesticated salmon as compared to their wild conspecifics, and given the success in improving athletic robustness of the wild strain, it still remains to be seen whether an exercise training protocol can be developed that will provide benefits to the salmon aquaculture industry.

Statement of relevance

This manuscript fits perfectly with the scope of aquaculture. We address the possibility that the Norwegian Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) breeding program that extensively focuses on commercial benefits traits may be compromising the cardiorespiratory system, which may contribute to the mortality of smolts after seawater transfer. We hypothesized that a combination of exercise-screening and exercise-training protocols could select for superior cardiorespiratory performance. This hypothesis was tested by comparing domesticated and wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon strains, and using comprehensive measurements of athletic and hypoxia performance in individual fish.

We believe this paper will be of specific interest to aquaculture professionals who are seeking the enhanced husbandry approaches for achieving higher survival rate over seawater transfer as well as general physiologists. To our knowledge our study is the first to comprehensively illustrate athleticism of domesticated Atlantic salmon from biochemical and cardiorespiratory system levels. Furthermore, we believe this is the first study to show the promising results of enhancing cardiorespiratory system of domesticated Atlantic salmon strain in a hatchery setting.

We used a suite of respiratory indices to evaluate athletic robustness and hypoxia performance in individual fish. We discovered that a domesticated strain of Atlantic salmon demonstrated a reduced athleticism and less plasticity in response to a short exercise-training regime compared with a wild strain of Atlantic salmon. We conclude that commercial aquaculture practices may trade off the robustness of the cardiorespiratory system, but not to an extent of completely losing the potential of benefiting from exercise training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Domestication compromises athleticism and respiratory plasticity in response to aerobic exercise training in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

            Aquaculture practice in Mexico is commonly carried out with some freshwater species, which are introduced in the region for its production, with technology developed in other countries. The growth of this activity has been slow, sometimes leading to loss of investments due to difficulties in the implementation of foreign technological packages, poor selection and inadequate management of the species, or farming sites, and even confusing legal procedures. Mexico stands out for the development of crops of exotic species more than native species, of which most are freshwater type. There are thirty‐four recorded species of freshwater fish, six of them are native and twenty‐eight are introduced species. The success of cultivating native species lies mainly in the process of selecting species with potential and certain characteristics. Mariculture is relatively new in Mexico; it has been intensibly developed, mostly in the north‐west of the country. It has a great potential due to the high commercial value of its species, excellent quality and demand in the market. Ornamental aquaculture is the most developed in Mexico; the main producer is the state of Morelos, with total technological expertise in production of introduced and native species. It should be noted that this success has been achieved, in some cases, with the support of projects from government institutions, universities, research centres, associations and private companies. Pointing out that the common factor for a successful aquaculture practice is an ecosystemic and sustainable approach, continuously improving practices and fish farming management, while complying with regulatory standards.

No differences in mortality or alevin body length were found between the crossing groups by the end of the yolk-sac stage. At later developmental stages, higher mortality and slower growth in one of the geographically distant hybrid groups indicated potential outbreeding depression.

In addition, our analyses show that increasing agricultural input efficiency (the amount of food produced per input of fertilizer or feed) would have environmental benefits for both crop and livestock systems. Further, for all environmental indicators and nutritional units examined, plant-based foods have the lowest environmental impacts; eggs, dairy, pork, poultry, non-trawling fisheries, and non-recirculating aquaculture have intermediate impacts; and ruminant meat has impacts ~100 times those of plant-based foods.

                        Since the handling of environmentally sensitive products requires close monitoring under prescribed conditions throughout the supply chain, it is essential to manage specific supply chain risks, i.e. maintaining good environmental conditions, and ensuring occupational safety in the cold environment. The purpose of this paper is to propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based risk monitoring system (IoTRMS) for controlling product quality and occupational safety risks in cold chains. Real-time product monitoring and risk assessment in personal occupational safety can be then effectively established throughout the entire cold chain.

                        In the design of IoTRMS, there are three major components for risk monitoring in cold chains, namely: wireless sensor network; cloud database services; and fuzzy logic approach. The wireless sensor network is deployed to collect ambient environmental conditions automatically, and the collected information is then managed and applied to a product quality degradation model in the cloud database. The fuzzy logic approach is applied in evaluating the cold-associated occupational safety risk of the different cold chain parties considering specific personal health status. To examine the performance of the proposed system, a cold chain service provider is selected for conducting a comparative analysis before and after applying the IoTRMS.

                        The real-time environmental monitoring ensures that the products handled within the desired conditions, namely temperature, humidity and lighting intensity so that any violation of the handling requirements is visible among all cold chain parties. In addition, for cold warehouses and rooms in different cold chain facilities, the personal occupational safety risk assessment is established by considering the surrounding environment and the operators’ personal health status. The frequency of occupational safety risks occurring, including cold-related accidents and injuries, can be greatly reduced. In addition, worker satisfaction and operational efficiency are improved. Therefore, it provides a solid foundation for assessing and identifying product quality and occupational safety risks in cold chain activities.

                        The cold chain is developed for managing environmentally sensitive products in the right conditions. Most studies found that the risks in cold chain are related to the fluctuation of environmental conditions, resulting in poor product quality and negative influences on consumer health. In addition, there is a lack of occupational safety risk consideration for those who work in cold environments. Therefore, this paper proposes IoTRMS to contribute the area of risk monitoring by means of the IoT application and artificial intelligence techniques. The risk assessment and identification can be effectively established, resulting in secure product quality and appropriate occupational safety management.

"Abstract

Commercially selective breeding of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) primarily for rapid growth may compromise cardiorespiratory robustness and its related phenotypes. Therefore, a suite of respiratory indices was used to evaluate aerobic capacity and hypoxia tolerance to test the hypothesis that exercise training can improve the athletic robustness in both domesticated and wild strains of Atlantic salmon, but with the domesticated strain having a less cardiorespiratory plasticity and a lower athletic robustness than the wild strain. We also tested a second hypothesis that a constant acceleration screening protocol should segregate fish according to athletic robustness based on their swimming ability. These hypotheses were tested with parr from Bolaks (domesticated) and Lærdal (wild) strains of Atlantic salmon that were reared under identical hatchery conditions. After screening into either inferior (bottom 20%) or superior (top 20%) swimmers, the four groups of fish (two strains and two swimming performance levels) either were given an 18-day exercise-training regime (an incremental water current of 2.0–2.8 fork lengths s− 1), or were maintained at the control water current (0.5 fork lengths s− 1) for 18 days. Subsequently, fish were sampled for metabolic enzyme analysis in red and white swimming muscles (citrate synthase, CS, and lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; n = 15 from each group) and their individual respiratory capacities were comprehensively assessed by measuring the standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum rate of oxygen uptake (ṀO2max), absolute aerobic scope (AAS), factorial aerobic scope (FAS), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), critical oxygen level (O2crit) and incipient lethal oxygen saturation (ILOS). Contrary to our expectations, the inferior and superior swimmers were indistinguishable in either strain and these data were pooled. While exercise training produced several tangible benefits for the wild fish, it produced very few for the domesticated fish. For example, the wild strain, but not the domesticated strain, had a significantly higher ṀO2max, AAS and EPOC as a result of training. Also, CS activity in red muscle increased after training to a larger extent in the wild strain than in the domesticated strain. When compared with the wild strain, the domesticated strain had a significantly lower ṀO2max, AAS, FAS and CS activity in white muscle. Thus, the domesticated strain appeared to be athletically less robust than the wild strain. These results imply that approximately ten generations of selective breeding for rapid growth in commercial aquaculture have reduced the overall athletic robustness of domesticated salmon as compared to their wild conspecifics, and given the success in improving athletic robustness of the wild strain, it still remains to be seen whether an exercise training protocol can be developed that will provide benefits to the salmon aquaculture industry.

Statement of relevance

This manuscript fits perfectly with the scope of aquaculture. We address the possibility that the Norwegian Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) breeding program that extensively focuses on commercial benefits traits may be compromising the cardiorespiratory system, which may contribute to the mortality of smolts after seawater transfer. We hypothesized that a combination of exercise-screening and exercise-training protocols could select for superior cardiorespiratory performance. This hypothesis was tested by comparing domesticated and wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon strains, and using comprehensive measurements of athletic and hypoxia performance in individual fish.

We believe this paper will be of specific interest to aquaculture professionals who are seeking the enhanced husbandry approaches for achieving higher survival rate over seawater transfer as well as general physiologists. To our knowledge our study is the first to comprehensively illustrate athleticism of domesticated Atlantic salmon from biochemical and cardiorespiratory system levels. Furthermore, we believe this is the first study to show the promising results of enhancing cardiorespiratory system of domesticated Atlantic salmon strain in a hatchery setting.

We used a suite of respiratory indices to evaluate athletic robustness and hypoxia performance in individual fish. We discovered that a domesticated strain of Atlantic salmon demonstrated a reduced athleticism and less plasticity in response to a short exercise-training regime compared with a wild strain of Atlantic salmon. We conclude that commercial aquaculture practices may trade off the robustness of the cardiorespiratory system, but not to an extent of completely losing the potential of benefiting from exercise training.",,,,,,,,,,,"This study investigates the replacement of vegetable oil (VO) in aquaculture feed for Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) with oil produced by the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi grown in lignocellulose (wheat straw) hydrolysate.

Plant oils are used in many different applications, including food, feed and biodiesel. Its replacement in non-food applications is desirable. For this purpose, yeast cells containing 43% lipids per g dry weight were mechanically disrupted and incorporated into the fish feed. There were no significant differences in this pilot study, regarding weight and length gain, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate, condition factor and hepatosomatic index between the control and the yeast oil fed group. Fatty and amino acid composition of diet from both groups was comparable.

      This study investigated the effect of dietary astaxanthin supplementation on egg quality and juvenile growth of long snout seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus). Captive breed seahorse broodstock were fed four diets composed of frozen shrimp [Atlantic ditch shrimp, Palaemonetes varians) used as a vector to deliver artificial diets with increasing levels of astaxanthin (0, 75, 100 and 125 mg kg−1 dry weight)]. The results indicated that the astaxanthin uptake into eggs from the enriched shrimp diets was highly efficient. Females fed unsupplemented astaxanthin diet produced similar‐sized eggs with lower concentration of astaxanthin than females fed diets with astaxanthin. The lower concentration of astaxanthin in the eggs was correlated with the production of smaller juveniles in comparison with the juveniles hatched from parents fed supplemented astaxanthin diets. Juvenile growth and survival was limited by their size on release from the male's pouch as at the end of 28‐day postparturition juveniles produced with the diet with no astaxanthin were still significantly smaller (P < 0.05) than those produced from parents fed astaxanthin‐supplemented diets. These results demonstrate a significant benefit of dietary astaxanthin supplementation in long snout seahorse diets in terms of improved egg quality and juvenile growth and survival.

The average daily mortality was 120 fish, resulting in a cumulative mortality rate of 29% within 10 d. The affected hybrid groupers displayed lethargy, excessive mucus production, rotten fins, congestion of livers and kidneys, and enlargement of spleens. Microscopically, general congestion of the brains and internal organs was evident. Vibrio harveyi and V. alginolyticus were successfully isolated from the diseased fish. The isolated pathogens were found to be sensitive to oxytetracycline and tetracycline, but resistant towards ampicillin and vancomycin. Experimental infections using the isolated V. harveyi (108 CFU/mL), V. alginolyticus (108 CFU/mL), and concurrent infection by V. harveyi (108 CFU/mL) and V. alginolyticus (108 CFU/mL) in juvenile Asian Seabass Lates calcarifer resulted in 60, 100, and 100% mortality, respectively, within 240 h postinfection. The experimentally infected Asian Seabass demonstrated similar clinical signs and histopathological changes as the naturally infected hybrid groupers. However, concurrently infected fish demonstrated severe clinical signs and histopathological changes compared with single infections. These results suggest that both isolates of Vibrio are pathogenic to fish and responsible for the disease outbreak. However, concurrent infection involving V. alginolyticus and V. harveyi leads to a more devastating impact to the cultured fish. This is the first report of concurrent Vibrio infection in cultured marine fish in Malaysia.

This paper presents a case study of the shrimp aquaculture sector in Vietnam to examine the factors behind the persistence of such port rejections. In particular, we focus on why the so-called better management practices (BMPs) are not appropriately adopted by many farmers and examine whether the number and types of information sources matter in farmers’ decisions on BMP adoption and whether BMP adoption actually leads to better performances. On the basis of our estimation using primary data collected in Southern Vietnam, we find that information sources and training experiences indeed matter in the adoption of a higher number of BMPs and that BMP adoption indeed reduces the possibility of disease outbreaks. These results prove the effectiveness of BMPs and suggest the importance of disseminating knowledge regarding them to farmers through experts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Better management practices and their outcomes in shrimp farming: evidence from small-scale shrimp farmers in Southern Vietnam,,,,,,,,,,

      Abstract
      
         
         In September 2016, a marine fish farm operator in Selangor, Malaysia, reported a disease outbreak affecting juvenile hybrid groupers (Camouflage Grouper Epinephelus polyphekadion × Tiger Grouper E. fuscoguttatus). The average daily mortality was 120 fish, resulting in a cumulative mortality rate of 29% within 10 d. The affected hybrid groupers displayed lethargy, excessive mucus production, rotten fins, congestion of livers and kidneys, and enlargement of spleens. Microscopically, general congestion of the brains and internal organs was evident. Vibrio harveyi and V. alginolyticus were successfully isolated from the diseased fish. The isolated pathogens were found to be sensitive to oxytetracycline and tetracycline, but resistant towards ampicillin and vancomycin. Experimental infections using the isolated V. harveyi (108 CFU/mL), V. alginolyticus (108 CFU/mL), and concurrent infection by V. harveyi (108 CFU/mL) and V. alginolyticus (108 CFU/mL) in juvenile Asian Seabass Lates calcarifer resulted in 60, 100, and 100% mortality, respectively, within 240 h postinfection.

The present study used PCR-DGGE and 454 pyrosequencing to assess if bacterial communities fingerprint associated to seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) skin mucus can be used to discriminate the geographic origin of fishes cultured in three semi-intensive fish farms. PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing results were congruent and suggested that this molecular approach has the potential to trace fish farms with a spatial resolution <500 m. Pyrosequencing results provided a detailed insight into the bacterial community composition of seabass skin mucus and revealed the existence of a core of bacterial communities within family Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae. This approach also allowed to recognized key OTUs that are potentially relevant to discriminate the geographic origin of the fish being surveyed. Overall, the present study increased our knowledge on farmed seabass microbiome and demonstrated that specific and unique bacterial taxa can act as natural signatures that allow us to trace fish to its respective geographic origin. Our study provides valuable clues that should be more investigated in future studies as a way to fulfill current traceability needs in the global trade of seafood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacterial communities 16S rDNA fingerprinting as a potential tracing tool for cultured seabass Dicentrarchus labrax

   ",,,,,,,,,,"Tilapias (family Cichlidae) are of importance in aquaculture and fisheries. Hybridisation and introgression are common within tilapia genera but are difficult to analyse due to limited numbers of species-specific genetic markers. We tested the potential of double digested restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing for discovering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to distinguish between 10 tilapia species. Analysis of ddRAD data revealed 1,371 shared SNPs in the de novo-based analysis and 1,204 SNPs in the reference-based analysis. Phylogenetic trees based on these two analyses were very similar. A total of 57 species-specific SNP markers were found among the samples analysed of the 10 tilapia species. Another set of 62 species-specific SNP markers was identified from a subset of four species which have often been involved in hybridisation in aquaculture: 13 for Oreochromis niloticus, 23 for O. aureus, 12 for O. mossambicus and 14 for O. u. hornorum. A panel of 24 SNPs was selected to distinguish among these four species and validated using 91 individuals. Larger numbers of SNP markers were found that could distinguish between the pairs of species within this subset.

We screened juvenile Atlantic salmon using 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms following a single, large aquaculture escape in the Northwest Atlantic and report the landscape-scale detection of hybrid and feral salmon (27.1%, 17/18 rivers). Hybrids were reproductively viable, and observed at higher frequency in smaller wild populations.

This paper studies the determinants for the decision of participation in tourism-related activities and examines whether tourism could be regarded as an alternative livelihood for the local people living in the MPAs. The propensity score matching approach is employed and a case study of Nha Trang Bay MPA is used for analysis with data from 140 locals. The results show that the tourism industry in the MPAs does not secure a better income for the local people if they stop their traditional livelihoods and enter the tourism industry. In other words, tourism should not be viewed in isolation with other existing income generating activities. Furthermore, low education, long distances between home and tourism destinations, and the pressure of supporting the whole family are the primary rationales preventing local people living in MPAs from participating in tourism industry.

We genotyped lice sampled from wild salmon and sea trout throughout Norway with the recently identified Phe362Tyr mutation that conveys resistance to organophosphates. These results were compared to data from lice sampled on farmed salmon in the same regions. The resistant (R) allele was observed in salmon lice from wild salmon and sea trout throughout Norway, although its frequency was highest in farming-intense regions. In most regions, the frequency of the R allele was higher in lice collected from wild sea trout than wild Atlantic salmon, and in all regions, the frequency of the R allele was similar in lice collected from wild sea trout and farmed Atlantic salmon. The R allele is only selected for in fish-farms where organophosphates are used for delousing. Therefore, our results suggest extensive exchange of lice between farmed and wild hosts, and indicate that in farming-dense regions in Norway, aquaculture represents a major driver of salmon louse population structure. Finally, these data suggest that the wild hosts within the regions studied will not delay the spread of resistance when organophosphates are used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Phe362Tyr mutation conveying resistance to organophosphates occurs in high frequencies in salmon lice collected from wild salmon and trout,,,,,,,,,,

The observed differentiation was primarily due to differences in allele frequencies, and was most likely a result of genetic drift.

Artisanal fleets represent one of the most sustainable fishing segments. Under the current Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a key issue consists of quantifying their contribution to employment and value added generation in local economies, but methodological tools have not been specifically developed to analyze this question and few empirical quantifications have been carried out due to lack of information (output, intermediate consumptions, primary inputs, etc.). This paper presents a methodology to measure the importance of artisanal fleets in an economy, on the basis of input-output (IO) analysis and by applying a disaggregation procedure that allows for distinguishing their activity when this information is aggregated into one of the sectors observable on an IO table. An empirical exercise has been conducted for the case of the artisanal fishing fleet of Asturias (region in Northwest Spain) by drawing together many different sources of data concerning its activity and by splitting the whole “Fisheries and aquaculture” sector in the symmetric IO table. The new IO table has allowed to estimate the impact of the artisanal fishing fleet's activity, showing that it exerted in 2010 higher multiplier effects on regional employment and income than the whole economy and the rest of the fisheries sector (basically, the industrial fleet). Findings also revealed that the potential of the artisanal fleet to generate gross value added is particularly important. Our results also suggest that sectoral disaggregation of IO tables is a highly versatile, useful and replicable methodology for socioeconomic studies of artisanal fisheries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A methodology for analyzing the impact of the artisanal fishing fleets on regional economies: An application for the case of Asturias (Spain),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peracetic acid (PAA) is a powerful disinfectant recently adopted as a therapeutic agent in aquaculture. A concentration of 10 mg L−1 PAA effectively suppresses zoospores of Aphanomyces astaci, the agent of crayfish plague. To aid in establishing safe therapeutic guideline, the effects of PAA on treated crayfish were investigated through assessment of histological changes and oxidative damage. Adult female signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus (n = 135) were exposed to 2 mg L−1 and 10 mg L−1 of PAA for 7 days followed by a 7 day recovery period in clean water. Superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in gill and hepatopancreas after three days exposure to 10 mg L1 PAA than in the group treated with 2 mg L−1 PAA and a control in only clean water. Catalase activity in gill and hepatopancreas remained unaffected by both exposures. Glutathione reductase was significantly decreased in gill of 10 mg L−1 PAA treated crayfish and increased in group exposed to 2 mg L−1 compared to control after 7 days exposure. Antioxidant enzyme activity in exposed groups returned to control values after recovery period. Gill, hepatopancreas, and antennal gland showed slight damage in crayfish treated with 2 mg L−1 of PAA compared to the control group. The extent and frequency of histological alterations were more pronounced in animals exposed to 10 mg L−1. The gill was the most affected organ, infiltrated by granular hemocytes and displaying malformations of lamella tips and disorganization of epithelial cells. After a 7 day recovery period, the infiltrating cells in affected tissues of the exposed crayfish began to return to normal levels.

Stakeholder participation is an important concept in marine environmental management; thus, their acceptance and opinions might influence policy decision making and effectiveness. This paper explores the factors that affect stakeholders' (traditional ocean users, including fishers and aquaculture farmers) acceptance and conducts an empirical analysis to determine the relationship among stakeholders' perceptions and acceptance. A total of 238 respondents completed a survey that was conducted in six coastal counties in western Taiwan. We used principle component analysis and two logistic regression models for the analysis: one model does not consider perception factors, while the other model estimates perception factors. The empirical results reveal that three perception factors related to the benefits of offshore wind farms significantly affect stakeholders' acceptance. Furthermore, the explanatory power, goodness-of-fit, and the predicted probability are greater when perception factors are considered in the logistic model. As a result, stakeholders' perceptions are important factors that influence their acceptance of OWFs along the western coast of Taiwan.

      The ability of the anesthetics metomidate hydrochloride and tricaine methanesulfonate (MS‐222) to mitigate the cortisol stress response of Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus was evaluated during a 10‐min confinement stress. The cortisol concentrations of Channel Catfish anesthetized in metomidate hydrochloride remained consistent throughout the 10‐min exposure; however, for fish anesthetized with MS‐222 and nonanesthetized fish, cortisol concentrations were approximately 7‐ and 22‐fold higher, respectively, than the baseline concentrations. While both anesthetics reduced cortisol concentrations relative to those of nonanesthetized fish, these results suggest that MS‐222 is an appropriate anesthetic to use during the initial 5 min of sedation and that metomidate hydrochloride is appropriate for longer periods of sedation.

Eco-certification has become an increasingly popular market-based tool in the endeavor to reduce negative environmental impacts from fisheries and aquaculture. In this study, we aimed at investigating which psychological consumer characteristics influence demand for eco-labeled seafood by correlating consumers’ stated purchasing of eco-labeled seafood to nine variables: environmental knowledge regarding seafood production, familiarity with eco-labels, subjective knowledge, pro-environmental self-identification, sense of personal responsibility, concern for negative environmental impacts from seafood production, perceived consumer effectiveness, gender and education. Questionnaires were distributed to consumers in Stockholm, Sweden, and the data were tested with multiple regression analysis using linear modeling and model averaging (n = 371). Two variables were the best predictors of stated purchasing of eco-labeled seafood: (i) recognition and understanding of eco-labels for seafood (Marine Stewardship Council, Fish for Life, Aquaculture Stewardship Council and KRAV); and (ii) concern for negative environmental impacts associated with seafood production. Meanwhile, consumer environmental knowledge was a weaker predictor. Results from this study suggest that strengthening the emotional component of consumer decision-making and improving the level of consumer familiarity with seafood eco-labels could stimulate more pro-environmental seafood consumption.

The world today is facing challenging crises like depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Biofuels can be an alternative solution to fossil fuels. Iran hosts a variety of weather conditions and its soil can grow different types of plants suitable for production of liquid biofuels. In this regard, the present research is an in-depth attempt to explore the potentials of Khuzestan Province as an agriculture hub of Iran to produce liquid biofuels. The studied biodiesel sources included oilseeds, animal fats and fish wastes, and the sources of bioethanol were wheat, sugarcane, sugar beet, rice, barley, maize, alfalfa, potato, grapes, apple, date and other local citrus fruits including orange, grapefruit, sweet lemon, sour lemon and sour orange. Results showed that the province's production potential was 1.04 Gl of bioethanol. A 5% addition of ethanol to gasoline (i.e. E5) can save 63.5 Ml of gasoline throughout the province. The estimated biodiesel production from animal fat- and oil-containing products and fish wastes is about 56 Ml in this province that can supply 2% of its total diesel fuel requirement. The estimated fat-based biodiesel production of Iran is 332.56 million liters. By adding the biodiesel production from oilseeds, Iran can produce 1.27 Gl of biodiesel fuel. This amount can supply 4.2% of the country's total diesel fuel consumption. The results for bioethanol and biodiesel production show promising alternatives. As a result of sound management of agricultural residues, E5 (5% ethanol, 95% gasoline) for SI engines and B2 (2% biodiesel and 98% diesel fuel) for diesel engines can be commercially produced as they impose no modifications to these engines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,An analysis of liquid-biofuel production potential from agricultural residues and animal fat (case study: Khuzestan Province),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   Summary
   
      
      Although recognised as cosmopolitan, ancient inhabitants of aquatic and terrestrial environments with major involvement in global nutrient cycling, cyanobacteria also present economic, supply, aesthetic, and health problems in the availability of water resources for human and animal use. Cyanobacterial hazards to human and animal health are presented by a wide array of toxins (cyanotoxins). These include long‐recognised cyanotoxins with causative actions in investigated waterborne health incidents. Exposure media and routes via which such incidents can occur are summarised. Novel cyanobacterial toxic compounds are also emerging and are a focus of current research. Increasing human demands on water resources, for industry, agriculture, aquaculture, recreation, and domestic uses, plus likely effects of climate change, are leading to increased problems with toxigenic, cyanobacterial mass populations. The effective risk management of such cyanobacterial problems requires feasible, robust methods for the monitoring and analysis of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins, the subject of this handbook.

",,,,,,,,,,"The potential consequences of cross-scale systemic environmental risks with global effects are increasing. We argue that current descriptions of globally connected systemic risk poorly capture the role of human–environment interactions. This creates a bias towards solutions that ignore the new realities of the Anthropocene. We develop an integrated concept of what we denote Anthropocene risk—that is, risks that: emerge from human-driven processes; interact with global social–ecological connectivity; and exhibit complex, cross-scale relationships. To illustrate this, we use four cases: moisture recycling teleconnections, aquaculture and stranded assets, biome migration in the Sahel, and sea-level rise and megacities. We discuss the implications of Anthropocene risk across several research frontiers, particularly in the context of supranational power, environmental and social externalities and possible future Anthropocene risk governance. We conclude that decision makers must navigate this new epoch with new tools, and that Anthropocene risk contributes conceptual guidance towards a more sustainable and just future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anthropocene risk,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted an integrated assessment of global production data from crop, livestock, aquaculture and fisheries sectors over 53 years to understand how shocks occurring in one food sector can create diverse and linked challenges among others. We show that some regions are shock hotspots, exposed frequently to shocks across multiple sectors. Critically, shock frequency has increased through time on land and sea at a global scale. Geopolitical and extreme-weather events were the main shock drivers identified, but with considerable differences across sectors. We illustrate how social and ecological drivers, influenced by the dynamics of the food system, can spill over multiple food sectors and create synchronous challenges or trade-offs among terrestrial and aquatic systems. In a more shock-prone and interconnected world, bold food policy and social protection mechanisms that help people anticipate, cope with and recover from losses will be central to sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food production shocks across land and sea,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The coastal zone in the Arctic is being extensively used for recreational activities. Simultaneously, there is an increasing pressure from commercial activities. We present results from a discrete choice experiment implemented in Arctic Norway, revealing how households in this region make trade-offs between recreational activities and commercial developments in the coastal zone. Our results show that, although people prefer stricter regulation of commercial activities, they welcome expansion in marine industries like aquaculture and marine fishing tourism. We also find evidence of high willingness-to-pay for new jobs; and this may partly explain the preferences for the commercial facilities in spite of the visual intrusion they create. On the other hand people expressed a clear dislike for littering of the beaches. Hence, the message to policy makers is to allow for commercial development in the coastal zone, but only under strict regulations, especially related to measures reducing the amount of marine debris.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Valuing coastal recreation and the visual intrusion from commercial activities in Arctic Norway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

             Methods
            
            Audiograms for 1.4 million workers (17 299 within AFFH) from 2003 to 2012 were examined. Prevalence, and the adjusted risk for hearing loss as compared with the reference industry (Couriers and Messengers), were estimated.

            The overall AFFH sector prevalence was 15% compared to 19% for all industries combined, but many of the AFFH sub‐sectors exceeded the overall prevalence. Forestry sub‐sector prevalences were highest with Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products at 36% and Timber Tract Operations at 22%. The Aquaculture sub‐sector had the highest adjusted risk of all AFFH sub‐sectors (PR = 1.70; CI = 1.42‐2.04).

         Aquatic animal diseases are a major constraint for increasing aquaculture production. Understanding the contribution of pathogen spread from infected aquaculture sites is critical in devising control measures in the event of an outbreak. We have reviewed the available literature on the persistence in the aquatic environment of several important viral pathogens of fish and crustaceans. These include infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus, infectious salmon anaemia virus, koi herpes virus, epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Taura syndrome virus and yellow head virus. Some trends were common to all viruses: (i) viability declined with increasing temperature (at temperatures above 0°C); (ii) higher biological loading in water correlated with reduction in detectable viable viruses; and (iii) virus decay in water is a function of time. Most aquatic animal viruses (AAVs) remained viable for several days or weeks. WSSV is particularly stable. Comparison of studies investigating survival parameters was sometimes difficult because of the different methods employed and different ways in which the data were presented. Data gaps are identified and experimental methods employed for testing critically assessed. The information presented in this review is directly relevant to design effective control measures for AAVs and to explore measures that reduce the economic impact of disease caused by these important pathogens.

   ",,,,,,,,,,"Mangroves provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling, soil formation, wood production, fish spawning grounds, ecotourism and carbon (C) storage1. High rates of tree and plant growth, coupled with anaerobic, water-logged soils that slow decomposition, result in large long-term C storage. Given their global significance as large sinks of C, preventing mangrove loss would be an effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy. It has been reported that C stocks in the Indo-Pacific region contain on average 1,023 MgC ha−1 (ref. 2). Here, we estimate that Indonesian mangrove C stocks are 1,083 ± 378 MgC ha−1. Scaled up to the country-level mangrove extent of 2.9 Mha (ref. 3), Indonesia’s mangroves contained on average 3.14 PgC. In three decades Indonesia has lost 40% of its mangroves4, mainly as a result of aquaculture development5. This has resulted in annual emissions of 0.07–0.21 Pg CO2e. Annual mangrove deforestation in Indonesia is only 6% of its total forest loss6; however, if this were halted, total emissions would be reduced by an amount equal to 10–31% of estimated annual emissions from land-use sectors at present.

Our studies suggest that the fish silage can be a cheaper and effective alternative to fishmeal in fish feeds, if carefully handled and properly processed. This is because fish silage is prepared from fish waste body viscera, which is utilized neither in human nor in animal feeds in the raw form. On the other hand, fishmeal is a main and expensive ingredient used in livestock and fish feeds. Utilization of fishmeal is on the rise while its production is on decline, which is continuously escalating its price. Furthermore, the manufacturing of fish silage is simple and requires relatively lesser inputs as compared to fishmeal manufacturing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nutritive evaluation of fish acid silage in Labeo rohita fingerlings feed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In West Africa, wild Nile tilapia genetic resources are abundant yet knowledge of fine-scale population structure and patterns of natural genetic variation are limited. Coinciding with this is a burgeoning growth in tilapia aquaculture in Ghana and other countries within the region underpinned by locally available genetic resources. Using 192 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers this study conducted a genetic survey of Nile tilapia throughout West Africa, sampling 23 wild populations across eight countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Mali, Gambia and Senegal), representing the major catchments of the Volta, Niger, Senegal and Gambia River basins. A pattern of isolation-by-distance and significant spatial genetic structure was identified throughout West Africa (Global FST = 0.144), which largely corresponds to major river basins and, to a lesser extent, sub-basins. Two populations from the Gambia River (Kudang and Walekounda), one from the western Niger River (Lake Sélingué) and one from the upper Red Volta River (Kongoussi) showed markedly lower levels of diversity and high genetic differentiation compared to all other populations, suggesting genetically isolated populations occurring across the region. Genetic structure within the Volta Basin did not always follow the pattern expected for sub-river basins. This study identifies clear genetic structuring and differentiation amongst West African Nile tilapia populations, which concur with broad patterns found in previous studies. In addition, we provide new evidence for fine-scale genetic structuring within the Volta Basin and previously unidentified genetic differences of populations in Gambia. The 192 SNP marker suite used in this study is a useful tool for differentiating tilapia populations and we recommend incorporating this marker suite into future population screening of O. niloticus. Our results form the basis of a solid platform for future research on wild tilapia genetic resources in West Africa, and the identification of potentially valuable germplasm for use in ongoing breeding programs for aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genetic diversity of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) throughout West Africa,,,,,,,,,,

   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An estimated two billion people worldwide currently suffer from micronutrient malnutrition, and almost one billion are calorie deficient. Providing adequate nutrition is a growing global challenge. Seafood is one of the most important sources of both protein and micronutrients for many, yet production from wild capture fisheries has stagnated. In contrast, aquaculture is the world’s fastest-growing food production sector and now supplies over half of all seafood consumed globally. Mariculture, or the farming of brackish and marine species, accounts for roughly one-third of all aquaculture production and has received increasing attention as a potential supplement for wild-caught marine fisheries. By analyzing global patterns in seafood reliance, malnutrition levels, and economic opportunity, this study identifies where mariculture has the greatest potential to improve human nutrition. We calculate a mariculture opportunity index for 117 coastal nations by drawing on a diverse set of seafood production, trade, consumption, and nutrition data. Seventeen primary variables are combined into country-level scores for reliance on seafood, opportunity for nutritional improvement, and opportunity for economic development of mariculture. The final mariculture opportunity score identifies countries with high seafood reliance combined with high nutritional and economic opportunity scores. We find that island nations in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean are consistently identified as countries with high mariculture opportunity. In other regions, nutritional and economic opportunity scores are not significantly correlated, and we discuss the implications of this finding for crafting appropriate development policy. Finally, we identify key challenges to ameliorating malnutrition through mariculture development, including insufficient policy infrastructure, government instability, and ensuring local consumption of farmed fish. Our analysis is an important step towards prioritizing nations where the economic and nutritional benefits of expanding mariculture may be jointly captured.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Global opportunities for mariculture development to promote human nutrition

Draft genomes of the two uncultured species, Ca. Ichthyocystis hellenicum and Ca. Ichthyocystis sparus, have been de novo sequenced and annotated from preserved material. Analysis of the genomes shows a compact core indicating a metabolic dependency on the host, and an accessory genome with an unprecedented number of tandemly arrayed gene families.

   ",,,,,,,,,,"Genetic architecture and phenotypic plasticity are important considerations when studying trait variation within and among populations. Since environmental change can induce shifts in the genetic architecture and plasticity of traits, it is important to consider both genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic variation. While there is overwhelming evidence for environmental effects on phenotype, the underlying mechanisms are less clear. Variation in DNA methylation is a potential mechanism mediating environmental effects on phenotype due to its sensitivity to environmental stimuli, transgenerational inheritance, and influences on transcription. To characterize the effect of environment on methylation, we created two 6 × 6 (North Carolina II) Chinook salmon breeding crosses and reared the offspring in two environments: uniform hatchery tanks and seminatural stream channels. We sampled the fish twice during development, at the alevin (larval) and fry (juvenile) stages. We measured DNA methylation at 13 genes using a PCR-based bisulfite sequencing protocol. The genetic architecture of DNA methylation differed between rearing environments, with greater additive and nonadditive genetic variance in hatchery fish and greater maternal effects in seminatural channel fish, though gene-specific variation was evident. We observed plasticity in methylation across all assayed genes, as well as gene-specific effects at two genes in alevin and six genes in fry, indicating developmental stage-specific effects of rearing environment on methylation. Characterizing genetic and environmental influences on methylation is critical for future studies on DNA methylation as a potential mechanism for acclimation and adaptation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rearing environment affects the genetic architecture and plasticity of DNA methylation in Chinook salmon,,,,,,,,,,

		Abstract
		
		Seaweed is one of the national income and coastal community income and includes one of exotic commodity of world trade because of its widely utilities. One of seaweed producer area of Jeneponto regency is Libukang island, with higher searesources dependence of that coastal island community, so most of them have a job as seaweed and fisherman. One of cultured seaweed in Libukang island is Kappaphycus alvarezii. Epiphyte is the attached plant on seaweed surface that potentially causing a disease, and being a competitor. The existance of epiphyte in the seaweed aquaculture can affect to the growth of seaweed and other bad-causing therats of seaweed. This study aimed to analyze the growth of seaweed K. alvarezii variety brown that epyphyte-infected in Libukang village, Jeneponto regency. The study was conducted on September-October 2014 in Libukang waters, Jeneponto regency, South Sulawesi. Location of study was 100 m distance from coastal line. The water quality analysis was conducted at Water Quality Laboratory, Fishery Major, Marine Science and Fishery Faculty, Hasanuddin University, Makassar. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the emergence of epyphyte on seaweed K. alvarezii aquaculture is does not make an effect to its growth, thus the lowest seaweed growth found in this aquaculture suspected of its lack of nutrient, particularly phospate and nitrate. Keywords: Seaweed, Kappaphycus alvarezii, epiphyte, growth rate.

   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The article presents the methodology for the assessment of the resource potential of the Arctic. The authors analyze the main elements of its economy that are involved in the food supply of both the Arctic regions and the whole country, as well as in export-import transactions. We state facts and figures for the implementation of the Arctic States policies with the field of both potentials in the Northern latitudes and the projects for utilizing living marine resources in previously unexplored waters. We reveal the dependence of the use of Arctic resources from geopolitical, economic and technological changes in the world. Previously, the economic activities in the Artic were conditioned by certain legal regimes. Now it may revised because of the differences in conceptual approaches when determining the external borders and delimitating continental shelf. We characterize the domestic model of Arctic exploration and the food supply system of territories. We identify the current problem of extraction of marine resources, their processing and delivery to the consumer. The intersectoral resource economy of the Arctic territories, the difficulties of fishery and fish processing, aquaculture production, the lack of support for local farms cultivating crops and producing of animal genetic resources are inherited from previous economic models. The basic features of the modern economy of the Arctic have significant country-specific differences depending on the policies that are implemented on one or another Arctic territory. This is manifested in the conditions created by the state as well as in the level of investment attractiveness and the quality of life. The factors affecting food security in Arctic areas are the following: the access to fishing stocks; support of the agricultural sector and rural households; the formation of state market mechanisms when creating interregional agrofood complexes; respect for animal genetic resources. We recommend enhancing the regulatory, institutional and economic opportunities of coastal regions, creating the conditions for competition development in the extraction and processing of natural resources in the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economic and Legal Mechanisms for Harnessing Natural Resource Potential of the Arctic in the Context of Food and Environmental Security,,,,,

      Hybrid catfish (♀ Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus × ♂ Blue Catfish I. furcatus) production ponds often produce a wide size range of fish, and payments to farmers may be reduced due to discounts for larger fish. In general, fish under 1 lb or over 4 lb may decrease the price paid to farmers, but this is highly dependent on individual processors. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of grading hybrid catfish fingerlings on the size distribution of harvested food fish. Three 0.25‐acre ponds were stocked with ungraded fingerlings (average weight = 0.05 lb; coefficient of variation [CV] = 78.0%) at 8,000 fish/acre. An additional three 0.25‐acre ponds were stocked with double‐graded fingerlings of the same average weight (0.05 lb) as the ungraded fingerlings but with a significantly reduced size variation (CV = 26.9%). Grading of the fingerlings had no significant effect on any production variable other than final size variation (ungraded fingerlings: CV = 48.2%; graded fingerlings: CV = 26.1%). Final mean weights were identical (1.1 lb) and feed conversion ratios were nearly identical (1.58 and 1.57) between the treatments. Survival and net production were similar between treatments. Overall, 13.5% of ungraded fish and 1.2% of graded fish were less than 0.5 lb at harvest; 5.6% of the ungraded fish and 0.1% of the graded fish were larger than 2.0 lb. Grading of hybrid catfish fingerlings is an effective means of decreasing food fish size variability without impacting production efficiency.

",,,,,,,,,,"Despite a worldwide boom in tilapia aquaculture, South Africa has failed to follow suit, resulting in a small, very much undeveloped local industry. Much of the justification for this reality lies on the inadequacy of the species used and the stringent legislation preventing the use of the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. With momentum gained in recent years, the local industry lobbying for the legalization of the O. niloticus has made great progress and its use in certain systems has recently been facilitated. This study was conducted to compare the growth performance between the indigenous Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, another African alternative gaining momentum in Zambia, the Three Spot tilapia, Oreochromis andersonii, and the globally reputable O. niloticus. The study was conducted in a biofloc technology (BFT) system, showing great potential as an environmentally friendly technology. The trial was run for 10 weeks with 60 fish/tank stocked into four repeats tanks per species. Fish were sampled on six occasions with a regression fitted to the mass data. Oreochromis niloticus showed a significantly higher growth rate with an average daily gain of 0.693 ± 0.018 g/day and the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1.01 ± 0.05, followed by O. mossambicus with average daily gain of 0.405 ± 0.025 g/day and FCR of 2.24 ± 0.16, and then O. andersonii with an average daily gain of 0.185 ± 0.025 g/day and an FCR of 2.53 ± 0.28, respectively. From this study, O. niloticus therefore appears to be the most adequate species for use in BFT systems in South Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A growth comparison among three commercial tilapia species in a biofloc system,,,,,,,,,,

         Agrochemicals have enabled to more than duplicate food production during the last century, and the current need to increase food production to feed a rapid growing human population maintains pressure on the intensive use of pesticides and fertilizers. However, worldwide surveys have documented the contamination and impact of agrochemical residues in soils, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including coastal marine systems, and their toxic effects on humans and nonhuman biota. Although persistent organic chemicals have been phased out and replaced by more biodegradable chemicals, contamination by legacy residues and recent residues still impacts on the quality of human food, water, and environment. Current and future increase in food production must go along with production of food with better quality and with less toxic contaminants. Alternative paths to the intensive use of crop protection chemicals are open, such as genetically engineered organisms, organic farming, change of dietary habits, and development of food technologies. Agro industries need to further develop advanced practices to protect public health, which requires more cautious use of agrochemicals through prior testing, careful risk assessment, and licensing, but also through education of farmers and users in general, measures for better protection of ecosystems, and good practices for sustainable development of agriculture, fisheries, and aquaculture. Enhanced scientific research for new developments in food production and food safety, as well as for environmental protection, is a necessary part of this endeavor. Furthermore, worldwide agreement on good agriculture practices, including development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their release for international agriculture, may be urgent to ensure the success of safe food production.

Enteritis has been increasingly recognized as one of the major obstacles for the lined seahorse Hippocampus erectus mass culture success. In the present study, the intestinal bacteria strains of the lined seahorses H. erectus suffered from enteritis were isolated, then their pathogenicities were confirmed by artificial infection, and one pathogenic bacteria strain named DS3 was obtained. The median lethal dose (LD50) of strain DS3 for 10 days was determined. The seahorses with different infection levels of uninfected (control), early stage of infection (ESI) and late stage of infection (LSI) were respectively sampled at 0, 3, 6 and 9 days post infection, and 12 immune parameters in the plasma were analyzed. The strain DS3 identified with a biochemical test combined with a molecular method was Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and its LD50 for 10 days was 1.3 × 103 cfu/fish. Six parameters including monocytes/leucocytes, leucocytes phagocytic rate, interleukin-2, interferon-α, lysozyme and immunoglobulin M exhibited a generally similar variation trend: highest in the control, second in the ESI and lowest in the LSI throughout the entire experiment. In view of the infection level of V. parahaemolyticus to H. erectus is largely decided by the seahorse's own immune capacity, therefore, these immune parameters were high in the non- or slightly infected seahorses, and low in the severely infected individuals may be an indicator for immune level.

      The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), originally from North America, was introduced to Mexico in 1888 and gradually distributed to various areas of the country. Currently, rainbow trout are cultivated in Mexico under a number of production systems, but this sector has grown less than 1% annually for the last 10 years. The present review analysed the production status of rainbow trout in Mexico, describing the key situations and actors that have influenced the establishment and current level of aquaculture development. Since its beginnings, rainbow trout cultivation in Mexico has depended on egg import due to insufficient egg and fry production by national hatcheries. Moreover, the industry is deficient in regard to a number of aspects in the production and management processes, with a notable necessity for specialists in the areas of production, health and sanitary diagnosis to rapidly and efficiently respond to situations such as low productivity or the presence of diseases. With such specialists, appropriate control and prevention decisions could be taken and acted upon. Likewise, the Mexican rainbow trout industry has high development potential and market expectations, but sector growth will require the active participation and commitment of competent authorities, in compliance with established Mexican regulations and laws, which are oriented towards advancing and protecting the fish farming industry.

",,,,,,,,,,,"The Maoist era has often been portrayed as a hindrance to China’s biotechnological development due to Lysenko doctrine and the communist government’s animosity to basic academic research. Yet some of China’s most developed sectors in biotechnology have been made possible by socialist enterprises in agriculture and science under Mao. One such example is China’s world-leading aquaculture biotechnology and genetic research on Asian carp. Although some associated China’s success in the area with the booming Asian market and a globalised biotech industry, the field’s advancement has been deeply rooted in earlier socialist history in reforming aquaculture and science. This article takes one essential technology used by biotech and aquaculture industries–the hormone-aided method in artificial carp reproduction–as a major case. By tracing the political, scientific and sociocultural lineages that made its invention and dissemination possible, this article unpacks the complex local and historical underpinning that defies prevalent understanding about the method as simply a variation of biotechnology’s global form. Particularly, the initial invention of the method was catalysed not only by state economic concerns but also by a socialist understanding of fishery and Maoist attempts to remold scientists. The two successful breakthroughs described in the article demonstrate two ways that scientists and technicians of different social and professional standings have appropriated available scientific and political resources to achieve personal and institutional goals. The dissemination of the method was further cemented through mass involvement during the Cultural Revolution.

   Summary
   
      
      Raising poultry flocks in urban backyard settings is becoming increasingly popular across the United States, but carries a risk of zoonotic infection. In the United States from 1990 to 2014, 53 outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to live poultry have been documented resulting in 2611 known illnesses, 387 known hospitalizations and five known deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015a, http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/resources/dont-play-chicken-with-your-health-poster-24x36_508.pdf). A cross‐sectional descriptive study was developed to better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices of urban backyard poultry owners regarding Salmonella risk and prevention. The study included a survey of bird health, animal husbandry and hygiene practices, and knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to Salmonella risk. Participants were videotaped while caring for their birds, and the recordings were transcribed using notational analysis to determine whether reported practices differed from observed practices. The results indicated that while a large proportion of participants knew that exposure to Salmonella is an inherent risk associated with raising poultry and harvesting eggs, their reported and observed practices would not consistently reduce risk of transmission of Salmonella and other zoonotic diseases. Approximately one in four participants reported performing practices that increase risk of inoculation, such as snuggling and kissing birds or eating/drinking near them. None of the participants were observed kissing their birds on video; however, snuggling (holding birds to clothes) or touching their face during routine care was observed in approximately two‐thirds of the video recordings. The video data provided a unique opportunity to compare reported practices with actions recorded during site visits. While the differences were not statistically significant, findings from our study suggest that flock owners may not accurately report the frequency with which risky practices are performed during routine animal care. Education and outreach targeting backyard flock owners should aim to improve husbandry and hygiene practices and reduce risk of zoonotic diseases associated with raising poultry in the backyard setting.

"Abstract

Aquaculture is one of the most dynamic food production systems in the world, with a fast expansion, especially in developing countries. Among this sector, the Chilean mussel industry has experienced a substantial increase, turning Chile into one of the leading producers and global exporters of mussels. Among the different links in the mussel production chain, the natural seed collection conducted by artisanal fishers of southern Chile has been a fundamental pillar for the development of the industry.

"Abstract

Aquaculture is one of the most dynamic food production systems in the world, with a fast expansion, especially in developing countries. Among this sector, the Chilean mussel industry has experienced a substantial increase, turning Chile into one of the leading producers and global exporters of mussels. Among the different links in the mussel production chain, the natural seed collection conducted by artisanal fishers of southern Chile has been a fundamental pillar for the development of the industry. Often, this sub-sector has been thought of as a homogeneous group, with similar responses to different challenges and public policies. However, this is likely an unrealistic assumption, making it necessary to understand the complexity of the local context and the heterogeneity of producer groups within the territory. Using surveys and multivariate statistical analysis, we explore typologies of artisanal mussel seed producers in southern Chile. The results proposed four seed producer entrepreneur typologies associated mainly with socioeconomic features and their interactions with the environment. These variables explain heterogeneity in organizational structures and equipment. Spatial location and environmental conditions are important factors that directly or indirectly influence the fishers' investment in equipment and sales contracts.

In this study we used novel animal-borne DO, temperature and depth sensors to determine the effect of extremes of DO and temperature on the vertical habitat use of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in aquaculture cages. Salmon showed a preference for temperatures around 16.5 to 17.5 °C, however, selection of preferred temperatures was trumped by active avoidance of low DO (<35% saturation) at the bottom of the cage. In addition to low DO, salmon also avoided warm surface waters (>20.1 °C), which led to a considerable contraction in the available vertical habitat. Despite their avoidance behavior, fish spent a large amount of time in waters with suboptimal DO (<60% saturation). These results show that vertical habitat contraction could likely be a significant consequence of climate change if the reduction in DO outpaces the increase in hypoxia tolerance through local adaptation. They furthermore highlight that site-specific environmental conditions and stock-specific tolerance thresholds may need to be considered when determining stocking densities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar to temperature and dissolved oxygen extremes established using animal-borne environmental sensors,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Rapid urbanization in Asia puts strong pressure on densely populated agricultural land in the peri-urban zone. It has created a specific feature, namely ‘Desakota’, as a mixed urban–rural zone which has been proposed to play an important role to support urban sustainability. However, preserving agriculture during urban expansion is hampered by the lack of understanding of its character and its economic, social, and ecological roles within the urban system. This research analyzed urbanization patterns in Jabodetabek Metropolitan Area (JMA) with Indonesia’s capital Jakarta at its core, and the dynamics of peri-urban agriculture in this context. Land use change analysis, descriptive and multivariate statistical approaches of social-economic panel data, and spatial mapping and clustering of agricultural types were applied. Results showed that rapid urbanization still continues at low development densities. It has led to the large-scale loss of farmland and increased land fragmentation. Interestingly, peri-urban agriculture still persisted and was even strengthened when JMA was hit by the economic crisis. While the area of agricultural land suffered heavy losses, the overall decline was less than expected due to conversion of woodlands into farmland. The number of farmers even increased but mostly because of a steep rise in landless farmers. Moreover, many peri-urban dwellers were still involved in on-farm and off-farm activities. We distinguished 10 agricultural types. Lowland horticulture and inland aquaculture were able to adapt and even benefit from urbanization due to proximity to the nearby urban market, whereas paddy fields, food crops and livestock were mostly displaced by urbanization and moved to the non-urbanized area. These results shed new light on the dynamics of peri-urban agriculture and indicate its persistent role in the peri-urban economy as well as supporting urban resilience during an economic crisis. Therefore, peri-urban agriculture should be regarded as a vital element of a megacity. Some strategies for its protection and development are suggested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The dynamics of peri-urban agriculture during rapid urbanization of Jabodetabek Metropolitan Area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Egypt has one of the world’s largest aquaculture sectors which makes a significant contribution to income, employment creation and food security. However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, peri-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia.

Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m2). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Characterisation of production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

		Abstract
		To investigate the effects of different hormonal treatments on the oocyte maturation in wild- caught grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), fish were subjected to 4 different hormonal treatments as follows: (a) a control group received 0.5 ml/kg B.W. physiological saline, (b) fish injected with 20 mg/kg carp pituitary extract (CPE) as a priming dose followed by 200 µg/kg sGnRHa as resolving dose, (c) fish injected with 200 µg/kg sGnRHa as a priming dose followed by the same injection as a resolving dose and, (d) fish received 20 mg/kg CPE as a priming dose followed by injection of 200 µg/kg sGnRHa in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant emulsion. All GnRHa treated groups received 20 mg/kg B.W. metoclopramide as dopamine antagonist (DA). The interval between two injections was 24 hrs. At 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post final injection ovarian samples were taken by soft plastic catheter and the maturation of oocytes was examined according to oocyte diameter, position of germinal vesicle and coalescence of oil droplets. The results showed that all hormonal treatments were significantly effective in progression of the oocyte maturation in comparison to control group. The treatments (b) and (d) were more effective than treatment (c) and resulted in final oocyte maturation and germinal break down. It was for the first time that emulsified GnRHa (sGnRHa-FIA) was shown to be effective in final oocyte maturation and ovulation of the species. The results showed that all hormonal treatments were effective in induction of oocyte maturation in wild-caught grey mullet and could be used in commercial hatcheries.

"ABSTRACT

Microbial colonization of the intestinal tract of commercial poultry is highly variable, likely due to the fact that poults and chicks are hatched and raised without exposure to adult birds and their microbiota. In industrial poultry production, it is hypothesized that most of the microbiota is obtained through horizontal transmission from the environment and very little by maternal transmission. The initial gut microbiota will therefore differ between flocks and companies based on environmental conditions at the hatchery. Day-old poults were collected from the hatchery of 2 companies at 3 different time points to monitor the initial colonizing microbiota by sequencing amplicons of marker genes for bacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), fungi, and archaea. Bacterial colonizers were distinct by company (pseudo-F 38.7, P ≤ 0.05) with the predominant bacteria at Company A being clostridia, specifically Clostridium celatum group, C. paraputrificum, and C. tertium. Predominant bacteria at Company B were Enterobacteriaceae, belonging to 2 different groups, one that included Escherichia; Shigella and Salmonella and the other Klebsiella; Enterobacter; and others. The predominant LAB at both companies were Enterococcus faecalis and E. gallinarum, confirmed by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of colonies picked from lactobacilli agar plate counts. The predominant fungi were Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with Candida sake or Alterneria sp. in some samples of Company A. Archaeal sequences were detected only in a single poult from Company B. The initial gastrointestinal colonizers of poults vary across company and time, signifying a strong environmental effect on microbiota acquisition. There was an indication of maternal effects in certain breeder flocks from Company B. Further work is necessary to determine how this variability affects microbiota succession and impacts growth and production of the birds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacteria and fungi in day-old turkeys vary among companies, collection periods, and breeder flocks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

Farmer participatory action research was carried out from July to December 2013 to design and construct a technology known as IFCAS (integrated floating cage aquageoponics system) for growing fish and vegetables in shaded ponds in the Barisal region of Bangladesh under the EU funded ANEP (Agriculture and Nutrition Extension Project). Here the terms aqua, geo and ponics means pond water, pond mud/soil and cultivation, respectively. Producing and regularly harvesting fish in shaded ponds and growing vegetables on surrounding dykes for household consumption was constrained. To overcome the difficulties, an IFCAS (3.66 m × 2.44 m = 9 m2) was set in each of 9 shaded ponds – 5 highly shaded ponds (HSP) and 4 moderately shaded ponds (MSP) – in which GIFT tilapia strain (Orechromis niloticus) was stocked at the rate of 100 m−3 cage. In the ponds, carp species (Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus cirrhosus and Cyprinus carpio) were stocked at the ratio of 1:2:2:1, and at the rate of 14,820 ha−1. Tilapia were fed floating feed and the carp were fed with supplementary feed. Vegetables were grown on the IFCAS scaffold, and tilapia were grown in the net-cage constructed underneath. Women members of HSP households participated fully in the action research in the production of vegetables and fish in IFCAS. Participating households started consuming vegetables and tilapia from IFCAS within 1.5 and 1 month of the start of the experiment, respectively. Average fish consumption of 20 kg household−1 was recorded within four months, of which more than 50% was tilapia from IFCAS. Overall fish and vegetable production was higher in MSP as compared to HSP. A financial analysis showed the benefit-cost ratio of IFCAS was >1, indicating the investment efficiency of IFCAS for farmers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Integrated floating cage aquageoponics system (IFCAS): An innovation in fish and vegetable production for shaded ponds in Bangladesh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluating studies over the past almost 40 years, this review outlines the current knowledge and research gaps in the use of isolated leucocytes in salmonid immunology understanding. This contribution focuses on the techniques used to isolate salmonid immune cells and popular immunological assays. The paper also analyses the use of leucocytes to demonstrate immunomodulation following dietary manipulation, exposure to physical and chemical stressors, effects of pathogens and parasites, vaccine design and application strategies assessment. We also present findings on development of fish immune cell lines and their potential uses in aquaculture immunology. The review recovered 114 studies, where discontinuous density gradient centrifugation (DDGC) with Percoll density gradient was the most popular leucocyte isolation method. Fish head kidney (HK) and peripheral blood (PB) were the main sources of leucocytes, from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Phagocytosis and respiratory burst were the most popular immunological assays. Studies used isolated leucocytes to demonstrate that dietary manipulations enhance fish immunity, while chemical and physical stressors suppress immunity. In addition, parasites, and microbial pathogens depress fish innate immunity and induce pro-inflammatory cytokine gene transcripts production, while vaccines enhance immunity. This review found 10 developed salmonid cell lines, mainly from S. salar and O. mykiss HK tissue, which require fish euthanisation to isolate. In the face of high costs involved with density gradient reagents, the application of hypotonic lysis in conjunction with mico-volume blood methods can potentially reduce research costs, time, and using nonlethal and ethically flexible approaches.

Mangrove ecosystem services, such as erosion prevention, shoreline protection and mitigation of climate change (through carbon sequestration), depend on the size and arrangement of forest patches, but we know little about broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation. Here we conduct a multi-scale analysis using global estimates of mangrove density and regional drivers of mangrove deforestation to map relationships between habitat loss and fragmentation. Mangrove fragmentation was ubiquitous; however, there are geographic disparities between mangrove loss and fragmentation; some regions, like Cambodia and the southern Caribbean, had relatively little loss, but their forests have been extensively fragmented. In Southeast Asia, a global hotspot of mangrove loss, the conversion of forests to aquaculture and rice plantations were the biggest drivers of loss (>50%) and fragmentation. Surprisingly, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, responsible for >15% of all deforestation in Southeast Asia, was only weakly correlated with mangrove fragmentation. Thus, the management of different deforestation drivers may increase or decrease fragmentation. Our findings suggest that large scale monitoring of mangrove forests should also consider fragmentation. This work highlights that regional priorities for conservation based on forest loss rates can overlook fragmentation and associated loss of ecosystem functionality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Global trends in mangrove forest fragmentation,,,,,,,,,,

They have framed sustainability as a technical problem that, at the farm level, is to be solved by better shrimp and management of ponds and businesses. Codes of conduct, standards, and regulations are expected to bring deviant practices into line. Shrimp farmers are often cornered in a challenging game of knowledge in which their livelihoods are at stake. In the commodity chain there are multiple relations with both suppliers and buyers, not all of which are trustworthy. The social networks shrimp farmers belong to are crucial for sifting out misinformation and multiplying insights from personal experience in learning by doing. Successful farmers become part of a learning culture through seminars, workshops, and clubs in which knowledge and practices are continually re-evaluated. The combination of vertical and horizontal relationships creates a set of alternative arenas that together are critical to bridging knowledge and action gaps for shrimp farmers. Government and industry initiatives for improving links between knowledge and practice for sustainability have largely succeeded when incentives are aligned: shrimp grow better in healthy environments, and using fewer resources means higher profits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Knowledge and innovation relationships in the shrimp industry in Thailand and Mexico,Knowledge and innovation relationships in the shrimp industry in Thailand and Mexico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Natural reproduction of adfluvial Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha has been documented in their native and introduced range but not in California, the southern end of their native range. A combination of anecdotal evidence and survey data suggests that successful spawning by Chinook Salmon reared in California reservoirs could be common. The planted juveniles are often from different basins and are genetically distinguishable from local salmon populations below reservoirs. Consequently, the possibility of behavioral and genetic interactions may lead to complications of restoration efforts via trap and haul programs. The full extent of this phenomenon needs to be documented before trap and haul programs are initiated to reintroduce salmon above reservoirs.

International production fragmentation has led to substantial changes in labor market, such as job creation/job loss, changing labor market structure and labor productivity. Such changes are perceived to affect CO2 emissions of those economies that participate in different parts of global value chains. This paper develops an accounting framework relating CO2 emissions to labor market shaped by global value chains. It analyses the influential factors driving CO2 emissions, and documents several pervasive empirical patterns. This is based on the recent environmental accounts developed by the European Commission and the World Input-Output Database over 2000–2014. The results show that the growth of CO2 emissions is primarily reduced by intensity effect, followed by labor market structural change due to participation in value chains, while it is driven by labor productivity effect and job creation. In particular, the foreign job creation effect is mostly emission-increasing, even in those economies with shrinking domestic employment. These results highlight the role of labor market and global value chains in climate policymaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Assessing the effects of labor market dynamics on CO2 emissions in global value chains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      This study evaluated the use of live and frozen copepods collected from shrimp ponds for rearing juveniles of the spotted seahorse Hippocampus kuda. Protein and HUFA contents in frozen copepods were all higher than in Artemia nauplii, the conventional live food for seahorse juveniles. The results of this study showed that copepods can be used as feed for rearing seahorse fry and juvenile. The spotted seahorse showed obvious preference for live copepods and rarely fed on dead copepods on the tank bottom. Furthermore, the combination of frozen copepods and live Artemia nauplii resulted in highest growth and highest survival of the experimental seahorses. Further research on possible effects of DHA:EPA ratio on survival and growth of young H. kuda is recommended.

   Abstract
   
      
      First feeding success is critical to larval marine finfish and optimization of live feed densities is important for larval performance and the economics of commercial hatchery production. This study investigated various rotifer feeding regimes on the prey consumption, growth and survival of yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi larvae over the first 12 days post hatch (dph). The common practice of maintaining high densities of rotifers (10–30 ind. mL−1) in the rearing tank was compared to a low density feeding technique, where 5–8 ind. mL−1 of rotifers were offered. A ‘hybrid’ feeding regime offered rotifers at the high density treatment until 5 dph and the lower feeding densities thereafter. There was no significant difference in larval survival (hybrid: 28.9 ± 7%, low density: 17.3 ± 5% and high density: 17.2 ± 9%) or growth (hybrid: 6.12 ± 0.18 mm, low density: 6.03 ± 0.10 mm and high density: 6.11 ± 0.23 mm) between treatments. Rotifer ingestion was independent of rotifer density throughout the trial and increased with larval age, with larvae at 4 dph ingesting 22 ± 1.5 rotifers larvae−1 h−1 and by 11 dph ingesting 59 ± 1.6 rotifers larvae−1 h−1. These data demonstrate that from first feeding, yellowtail kingfish larvae are efficient at capturing prey at the densities presented here and consequently significant savings in rotifer production costs as well as other potential benefits such as facilitation of early weaning and improved rotifer nutritional value may be obtained by utilizing lower density rotifer feeding regimes.

   ","ABSTRACTABSTRACTThis article examined the profitability of aquaponics in the U.S. Midwest. Three sources of data were considered for the study: (1) three active aquaponics farms, (2) a university greenhouse experiment, and (3) published research. The first analysis compares the economics of aquaponics and hydroponics systems under similar operations. Results suggest that the aquaponics system requires higher investment and operating cost but has lower production of vegetables compared with the hydroponics system. However, if aquaponics vegetable production is managed as an organic production, and the produce is sold at 20% premium price, aquaponics becomes profitable. The second analysis constructed three different representative farm sizes of aquaponics production of basil and tilapia—small, medium, and large. The production of basil provides better economic returns than the fish. All farm sizes are feasible when the basil price is above $10.00 per kg. The larger farm has the best results because of lower cost of production.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economic analysis of aquaponics and hydroponics production in the U.S. Midwest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        This study examines the cost, returns, profitability of pond fish farm, requirements, adequacy, sources and utilization patterns of credit and problems associated with pond fish farming in Madhupur Upazila of Tangail district. A total of 60 farmers with small traditional types of ponds were randomly selected for this study. Both description and econometric analysis were used. Human labour was the most important and one of the largest inputs used for pond fish production. The average per acre human labour cost, fingerlings cost, feed cost, chemical fertilizers cost, manure cost, and lime cost were Tk. 9345, Tk. 18506, Tk.10476, Tk.3759, Tk. 329, and Tk.1605, respectively. Pond rental value was calculated at Tk. 11537 per acre for one year which shared 26.42 percent of total costs of pond fish production.  Gross return was Tk. 70928 per acre. Gross margin and net return of the pond fish farm were Tk.38118 and Tk. 24081 per acre respectively. The BCR was 1.514. Out of 60 farmers, only 11 farmers received loans from different sources and 86.67 percent of applied amount received. About 83 percent of the loan used for operating expenditure of farming and rest 17 percent  loan used for non-farm expenditure. There were some problems in fish farming, such as insufficient water, high feed cost etc. Government needs to provide subsidized feed, technical supports and credit facilities for the small scale fish farmers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

   ","AbstractAbstractThe present study was undertaken to investigate the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of sublethal concentrations of hexavalent chromium (potassium dichromate) in the Indian major carp, Labeo rohita. The 96 h LC50 value of potassium dichromate estimated was 118 mg L−1 by probit analysis using SPSS (version 16.0) software. Based on 96 h LC50 value, three sublethal test concentrations of potassium dichromate (29.5, 59.0 and 88.5 mg L−1) were selected and specimens were exposed in vivo to these test concentrations for 96 h. The mutagenic and genotoxic effects of potassium dichromate were evaluated in gill and blood cells using micronucleus (MN) test and comet assay. In general, significant (p < 0.05) effects due to the concentrations and the exposure durations were observed in exposed specimens. The MN induction was highest at 96 h at all the test concentrations in the peripheral blood. A similar trend was observed for the DNA damage, measured in terms of percentage of tail DNA, in erythrocyte and gill cells.

   ","ABSTRACTABSTRACTThe oceans economy is a crucial factor in global economic growth and development, offering not only great opportunities but also challenges and risks. Most activities related to our economic exploitation of the maritime environment, however, do not conform with the notions of a ‘blue economy’, as the economic use of maritime resources and the sea often precludes a focus on a sustainable maritime environment. South Africa has a large sea area, abundant marine resources, considerable maritime infrastructure, and the oceans economy is an important contributor to GDP. The South African government’s intention to ensure growth and development in the maritime sector is part of Operation Phakisa, an inherent element of the Nine-Point Plan aimed at stimulating economic growth and development. The focus of this paper is on the South African oceans economy and its potential contribution to socioeconomic growth, development, and transformation. Emphasis will fall on the current state of the oceans economy, new public and private sector initiatives, maritime security, environmental care, maritime governance, as well as assumptions on growth potential and future prospects.",,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Oceans economy, blue economy, and security: notes on the South African potential and developments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Sturgeons (Acipenseridae) are the most imperilled group of fishes globally. Yet, many species remain important targets of recreational anglers. In the Saint John River, New Brunswick, Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum is a popular species targeted by recreational anglers. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has placed Shortnose Sturgeon on the Red List as “Vulnerable,” and therefore this species is afforded protection from harvest in Canada by the federal Species at Risk Act. Here, we evaluated physiological stress using two principal components axes, RC1 and RC2, generated from blood lactate, glucose, and pH, hematocrit, and reflex impairment of sturgeon exposed to exhaustive chase experiments at a hatchery and angled sturgeon that were captured during an annual fall competitive angling event. Physiological indicators of stress increased with holding time for Shortnose Sturgeon transferred into a tank and for sturgeon exposed to chase trials. Circulating metabolite concentrations were not associated with reflex impairment. The odds of reflex impairment increased as a function of air exposure, with a 1‐min increase in air exposure increasing the odds of impairment by 1.78. All sturgeon survived hatchery experiments. Most of the wild Shortnose Sturgeon captured in the fishing derby (71%) exhibited reflex impairment, and 38% had superficial injuries such as cuts or wounds. None of these factors were associated with physiological disturbance, although ordinated stress physiology axes were elevated both 1 and 2 h after initial sampling, which was predictive by the holding time prior to weigh‐in and measuring fish size. All fish were hooked in the mouth and each was released alive from the derby. Taken together the evidence suggests that Shortnose Sturgeon are resilient to recreational angling interactions, yet managers could use this information to improve best practices of catch‐and‐release angling.

The same features that once endeared this small freshwater minnow to developmental biologists combined with its relatively high genetic similarity to mammals and the advent of new, more efficient methods for genome editing are now helping to spur expanded growth in its usage in various fields, including toxicology, drug discovery, transplant biology, disease modeling, and even aquaculture. Continued maturation and adoption of the zebrafish model system in these and other fields of science will require that methods and approaches for husbandry and management of these fish in controlled settings be refined and improved to the extent that, ultimately, zebrafish research becomes more reproducible, defined, cost-effective, and accessible to the masses.

"Abstract

The present study assesses the production costs, profitability and the importance of inputs (seed, feed, fertilizer and labor) in striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) production under polyculture system in Bangladesh. A survey was conducted by structured questionnaire during November 2011–June 2012 that included 201 pangasius farmers of four locations, namely Bogra, Jessore, Mymensingh and Narshingdi districts. Based on the aquaculture operation area and management characteristics, these farms were categorized into small, medium and large scale farms. The average annual production costs, gross income, net income and benefit cost ratios were higher (P ≥ 0.05) in medium farms, followed by small and large farms and these parameters varied significantly (P ≤ 0.05) between farm locations. The Cobb-Douglas production function model was applied to evaluate several independent variables (inputs) related with fish production. The results showed that feeding and stocking density were the most significant factors influencing fish production. The analysis also showed an increasing return to scale, implying an increase in inputs will more than proportionately increase production. The estimated marginal physical productivity of the inputs suggests that stocking density, feeding and labor should be increased in order to increase farm profitability. However, some inputs were inefficiently used by different farm categories. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that farmers should consider more attention on the use of these inputs more efficiently in order to facilitate a sustainable increase in fish production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Production economics of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, Sauvage, 1878) farming under polyculture system in Bangladesh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survey was conducted by structured questionnaire during November 2011–June 2012 that included 201 pangasius farmers of four locations, namely Bogra, Jessore, Mymensingh and Narshingdi districts. Based on the aquaculture operation area and management characteristics, these farms were categorized into small, medium and large scale farms. The average annual production costs, gross income, net income and benefit cost ratios were higher (P ≥ 0.05) in medium farms, followed by small and large farms and these parameters varied significantly (P ≤ 0.05) between farm locations. The Cobb-Douglas production function model was applied to evaluate several independent variables (inputs) related with fish production. The results showed that feeding and stocking density were the most significant factors influencing fish production. The analysis also showed an increasing return to scale, implying an increase in inputs will more than proportionately increase production. The estimated marginal physical productivity of the inputs suggests that stocking density, feeding and labor should be increased in order to increase farm profitability. However, some inputs were inefficiently used by different farm categories. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that farmers should consider more attention on the use of these inputs more efficiently in order to facilitate a sustainable increase in fish production.",,,,,,,,,,,"Domestic wastewater and agricultural activities are important sources of nutrient pollutants such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Upon reaching freshwater, these nutrients can lead to extensive growth of harmful algae, which results in eutrophication. Many Chinese lakes are subject to such eutrophication, especially in highly polluted areas, and as such, understanding nutrient fluxes to these lakes offers insights into the varying processes governing pollutant fluxes as well as lake water quality. Here we analyse water quality data, recorded between 2006 and 2014 in 862 freshwater lakes in four geographical regions of China, to assess the input of phosphorus from human activity. We find that improvements in sanitation of both rural and urban domestic wastewater have resulted in large-scale declines in lake phosphorus concentrations in the most populated parts of China. In more sparsely populated regions, diffuse sources such as aquaculture and livestock farming offset this decline. Anthropogenic deforestation and soil erosion may also offset decreases in point sources of pollution. In the light of these regional differences, we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for water quality control would be beneficial for the future health of Chinese lakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Decline in Chinese lake phosphorus concentration accompanied by shift in sources since 2006,,,,,,,,,,

Osmoregulatory adaptation is the most crucial change, necessitating functional adaptations of the gills, kidney and intestine. Additionally, novel pathogens, microbes and dietary items are encountered in the saltwater environment, which suggests major changes in the intestinal microbiota following movement to saltwater. Here we compared the intestinal microbiota harboured in the distal digesta of Atlantic salmon freshwater fish (FW) kept in a commercial Scottish freshwater hatchery with that of their full-siblings after seawater acclimatisation (SW) by a 16S rRNA (V3-V4) high-throughput sequencing approach. Alpha- and beta-diversity were found significantly higher in FW compared to SW, both in terms of richness and diversity. Metastats analysis identified a higher number of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) unique to FW compared to SW, with an additional 238 OTUs found at significantly different abundance. A core microbiota of 19 OTUs was identified in 100% of all fish, which indicates that certain microbes are maintained to fulfil minimal functions within the gut. Furthermore we show that the uniqueness of the respective microbial profiles can be correlated with significant differences in KEGG pathways including lipid and amino acid metabolism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Seawater transfer alters the intestinal microbiota profiles of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.),,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The notion of clusters has increasingly been integrated into regional economic development policies. This paper examines the extent to which maritime cluster policy strategies in Québec's coastal region are associated with employment growth in the region, and more specifically, science-based, skill-intensive employment. Whilst early evaluations conducted about a decade ago suggested that cluster policies implemented from the mid-1990s onwards had little effect, the question addressed in this paper concerns their effect over the long term. Based on descriptive statistics and trend analysis, the results reveal that the sectors targeted by the cluster policies have tended to grow more slowly within the cluster, and that jobs in the cluster are decreasingly science-intensive. At best, cluster policies have had a weak and diffused effect. This is in keeping with other recent work on clusters, and calls into question policy attempts to generate cluster dynamics in regions where these do not emerge spontaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Québec’ coastal maritime cluster: Its impact on regional economic development, 2001–2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this proof of concept, we engineered the chloroplast genome of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for the expression of a dsRNA cassette targeting a shrimp yellow head viral gene. We used a previously described chloroplast transformation approach that allows for the generation of stable, marker-free C. reinhardtii transformants without the supplementation of antibiotics. The generated dsRNA-expressing microalgal strain was then used in a shrimp feeding trial to evaluate the efficiency of the algal RNAi-based vaccine against the virus. Shrimps treated with dsRNA-expressed algal cells prior to YHV infection had 50% survival at 8 day-post infection (dpi), whereas 84.1% mortality was observed in control groups exposed to the YHV virus. RT-PCR using viral specific primers revealed a lower infection rate in dsRNA-expressing algae treated shrimp (55.6 ± 11.1%) compared to control groups (88.9 ± 11.1% and 100.0 ± 0.0%, respectively).

Levels of amino acids in the hepatic portal vein and caudal vein were measured at intervals after a single force-feeding of fishmeal, four plant protein concentrates, and a mixture of the concentrates with or without supplementation of three limiting amino acids. Each ingredient affected plasma amino acid levels in a singular manner when fed individually but without predictable additive effects when fed as a mixture. Amino acid supplementation altered uptake and plasma concentrations of all the essential amino acids.

"Abstract

Several case reports show allergy and anaphylactic reactions to the fish parasite Anisakis in the domestic and occupational setting. Compared with other well-studied parasitic diseases, fish-borne parasitic zoonoses do not get enough attention, especially because these zoonoses have been limited for the most part to populations living in middle-income countries. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases caused by nematodes result in infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as allergic reactions against parasite antigens. With the globalization of the seafood industry, the risk of humans acquiring anisakiasis in developed countries appears to be underestimated. The risk of infection with Anisakis simplex and related parasites of fish has been recognized for some time, but it is now emerging that indigestion of material from dead parasites in food also present a danger. The resulting allergic reactions range from rapid onset and potentially lethal anaphylactic reaction to chronic, debilitating conditions.

"Abstract

Marine and coastal ecosystems provide multiple benefits that are fundamental to human wellbeing, but human actions are disrupting and impacting the Earth's ecosystems at an alarming rate. The Ecopath approach was designed to understand the impact of the wide range of anthropogenic pressures that are exerted on the oceans, and of management options for countering these, and it has over the last thirty years grown into a complex and capable modelling framework: “Ecopath with Ecosim” – with Ecospace added on. Exciting new developments of the approach are contributing to address critical and complex issues related to the health of marine ecosystems such as invasion of species, illegal fishing activities, climate change and the development of new activities (e.g., aquaculture and infrastructure development) in coastal areas.

This Special Issue presents new findings from selected case studies around the world using advanced features of Ecopath with Ecosim that were presented at the International Conference “Ecopath 30 Years-Modelling ecosystem dynamics: beyond boundaries with EwE” (November 2014, Barcelona, Spain). These contributions showcase new capabilities and findings of Ecopath with Ecosim models applications. Together these papers show that a range of diverse ecological, economic, social and governance drivers are often interacting at dynamic and temporal scales to modify marine resources, which underlines that managing marine ecosystems needs a continuous effort to integrate multiple processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Modelling marine ecosystems using the Ecopath with Ecosim food web approach: New insights to address complex dynamics after 30 years of developments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

            The objectives of this effort were to identify basic descriptors of the east Mississippi (MS) catfish industry, identify prevalent diseases affecting this region, and determine the direct economic impacts of these diseases representing the 2016 production season. Data from east MS catfish operations were collected over a 3‐month period during the late spring through early summer of 2017. A 95% confidence interval (CI) with finite correction was used to make inferences on the population. The number of operations (115) and number of hectares used for catfish production (4,900 ha) were identified by personal communications and confirmed by satellite imagery. Producers were surveyed a second time by e‐mail (29.6% response) to identify basic industry descriptors, the most predominant catfish diseases of east MS, and their respective direct economic impact. The top‐three diseases, as reported by producers, were virulent Aeromonas hydrophila, the “other” disease category, and Flavobacterium columnare. Producers were surveyed a third time by e‐mail (34% response) to identify the mean (±95% CI) of regional catfish production (8,070 ± 783 kg/ha). Foregone sales loss attributed to catfish disease was reported as the sum of fish loss ($10 million) and production loss ($4.3 million). Foregone income loss resulted from the increased expenditures associated with catfish disease and included medicated feed ($1.9 million), chemical applications ($0.6 million), and miscellaneous ($0.1 million). The total direct economic impact of catfish diseases for the 2016 east MS production season was reported as the sum of foregone sales and foregone income and totaled $16.9 million.

         Body length measurements and growth rate (GR) analysis are important steps in research on the ecology of early development stages of fish. In order to obtain accurate results, the lengths of field‐collected and preserved larvae must be corrected for shrinkage. Northern Pike Esox lucius larvae were kept in the laboratory in freshwater conditions (300‐L tank; temperature = 16°C), where they were fed six times a day ad libitum with aquaculture feed. Every 3 d over a period of 30 d, a subsample of approximately 30 larvae was collected, measured, and placed in separate vials in 96% alcohol and 4% formalin.

      Abstract
      
         
         Body length measurements and growth rate (GR) analysis are important steps in research on the ecology of early development stages of fish. In order to obtain accurate results, the lengths of field‐collected and preserved larvae must be corrected for shrinkage. Northern Pike Esox lucius larvae were kept in the laboratory in freshwater conditions (300‐L tank; temperature = 16°C), where they were fed six times a day ad libitum with aquaculture feed. Every 3 d over a period of 30 d, a subsample of approximately 30 larvae was collected, measured, and placed in separate vials in 96% alcohol and 4% formalin. All of the larvae (8.8–34 mm SL; n = 276) were measured again after 90 d of preservation. The shrinkage ranged from 0% to 11.6%, averaging 3.42% in alcohol (n = 134) and 3.74% in formalin (n = 139). The difference was not statistically significant. In both preservatives, the relative shrinkage (%) was higher for small fish than for large fish. The length correction for 8–34‐mm SL fish in both alcohol and formalin should be done by adding 0.7 mm to the length measured after preservation. Shrinkage did not affect fish GRs estimated based on linear regression fitted to size‐at‐age data (0.645 mm/d for unpreserved larvae and 0.650 mm/d for preserved larvae).

Probiotics are a promising strategy as evidenced by benefits demonstrated in intensive larviculture of various marine fish species. In this study we investigate the effects of a mixed Bacillus species (B. licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens) probiotic on rearing of larval common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). Experimental treatments included (1) probiotics supplemented to the water and live feed, (2) probiotics supplemented to the water only, and (3) no probiotic controls. Data from two separate trials indicated up to 2.5 times higher survival with probiotic addition, as well as 20% higher survival 7 days following a transport event. These benefits were not explained by faster growth, measured water quality parameters, or innate immune enzyme activities. Microbiota analysis indicated the importance of system stabilization prior to larval stocking to improve rearing success and probiotic performance. ied Potential probiotic benefits include accelerated gastrointestinal tract development, enhanced immunity, inhibition of opportunistic bacteria, and improvements to water quality parameters. Results suggest this probiotic should be tested in other marine fish species in order to reduce larval rearing bottlenecks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Benefits of a Bacillus probiotic to larval fish survival and transport stress resistance,,,,,,,,,,

            The objectives of this effort were to identify basic descriptors of the east Mississippi (MS) catfish industry, identify prevalent diseases affecting this region, and determine the direct economic impacts of these diseases representing the 2016 production season. Data from east MS catfish operations were collected over a 3‐month period during the late spring through early summer of 2017. A 95% confidence interval (CI) with finite correction was used to make inferences on the population. The number of operations (115) and number of hectares used for catfish production (4,900 ha) were identified by personal communications and confirmed by satellite imagery. Producers were surveyed a second time by e‐mail (29.6% response) to identify basic industry descriptors, the most predominant catfish diseases of east MS, and their respective direct economic impact. The top‐three diseases, as reported by producers, were virulent Aeromonas hydrophila, the “other” disease category, and Flavobacterium columnare. Producers were surveyed a third time by e‐mail (34% response) to identify the mean (±95% CI) of regional catfish production (8,070 ± 783 kg/ha). Foregone sales loss attributed to catfish disease was reported as the sum of fish loss ($10 million) and production loss ($4.3 million). Foregone income loss resulted from the increased expenditures associated with catfish disease and included medicated feed ($1.9 million), chemical applications ($0.6 million), and miscellaneous ($0.1 million). The total direct economic impact of catfish diseases for the 2016 east MS production season was reported as the sum of foregone sales and foregone income and totaled $16.9 million.

Macro-algae is increasingly gaining attention as a potential feedstock for biofuels and as a potential alternative fuel for aviation. Technological aspects are showing promise, and being examined more widely. This paper uses a strategic management perspective to complete an initial macro-environmental scan of the potential opportunities and threats to a seaweed biofuels industry. This is in response to calls to look beyond technological aspects, and highlights the importance of social acceptance. It is clear that very little is known about the potential economic, social, environmental and political/legal issues that might arise in the development of this industry. While we can look at the development of other, more established renewable technologies and seaweed industries away from the UK to highlight potential issues this does not give us a clear picture. Further research is needed to ensure that a proactive approach is used to research and inform stakeholders who will affect the further technological development and commercialization of the industry.

Here, a factorial design with reciprocal cross, common rearing of eggs and subsequent lifecycle stages and pedigree assignment using DNA microsatellites was used to separate these effects and estimate dominance (d2) and maternal (m2) ratios in Nile tilapia for six commercial traits. The study included observations on 2524 offspring from 155 full-sib families. Substantial contributions of dominance were observed (P < 0.05) for body depth (BD) and body weight at harvest (BWH) with estimates of d2 = 0.27 (s.e. 0.09) and 0.23 (s.e. 0.09), respectively in the current breeding population. In addition the study found maternal variance (P < 0.05) for BD, BWH, body thickness and fillet weight explaining ~10% of the observed phenotypic variance. For fillet yield (FY) and body length (BL), no evidence was found for either maternal or dominance variance. For traits exhibiting maternal variance, including this effect in evaluations caused substantial re-ranking of selection candidates, but the impact of including dominance effects was notably less. Breeding schemes may benefit from utilising maternal variance in increasing accuracy of evaluations, reducing bias, and developing new lines, but the utilisation of the dominance variance may require further refinement of parameter estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maternal, dominance and additive genetic effects in Nile tilapia; influence on growth, fillet yield and body size traits",,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that TDA producers with additional novel features are present in the oceanic environment. We isolated 42 TDA-producing R. mobilis strains during a global marine research cruise. While highly similar on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene level (99–100% identity), the strains separated into four sub-clusters in a multilocus sequence analysis. They were further differentiated to the strain level by average nucleotide identity using pairwise genome comparison. The four sub-clusters could not be associated with a specific environmental niche, however, correlated with the pattern of sub-typing using co-isolated phages, the number of prophages in the genomes and the distribution in ocean provinces. Major genomic differences within the sub-clusters include prophages and toxin-antitoxin systems. In general, the genome of R. mobilis revealed adaptation to a particle-associated life style and querying TARA ocean data confirmed that R. mobilis is more abundant in the particle-associated fraction than in the free-living fraction occurring in 40% and 6% of the samples, respectively. Our data and the TARA data, although lacking sufficient data from the polar regions, demonstrate that R. mobilis is a globally distributed marine bacterial species found primarily in the upper open oceans.

Human contact with and consumption of fishes presents hazards from a range of bacterial zoonotic infections. Whereas many bacterial pathogens have been presented as fish-borne zoonoses on the basis of epidemiological and phenotypic evidence, genetic identity between fish and human isolates is not frequently examined or does not provide support for transmission between these hosts. In order to accurately assess the zoonotic risk from exposure to fishes in the context of aquaculture, wild fisheries and ornamental aquaria, it is important to critically examine evidence of linkages between bacteria infecting fishes and humans. This article reviews bacteria typically presented as fish-borne zoonoses, and examines the current strength of evidence for this classification. Of bacteria generally described as fish-borne zoonoses, only Mycobacterium spp., Streptococcus iniae, Clostridium botulinum, and Vibrio vulnificus appear to be well-supported as zoonoses in the strict sense. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, while transmissible from fishes to humans, does not cause disease in fishes and is therefore excluded from the list.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources recently enhanced efforts to rehabilitate brook trout in Minnesota waters by imposing restrictive harvest regulations intended to produce more large individuals adopting a coaster life-history. The agency evaluated effects of the regulation changes by conducting electrofishing stream surveys concurrently with changes and three additional times over the next 16 years. Catch per unit effort of brook trout across all streams was similar among sampling periods. Generalized linear mixed models indicated a greater proportional size structure (number ≥ 330 mm/number ≥ 200 mm) and proportion of older fish (≥ age 3) after the regulation change. Genetic analyses indicated that individuals from coaster hatchery strains, which were stocked in nearby jurisdictions, made up only 5.6% of all individuals in Minnesota streams and 12% of individuals ≥ 330 mm, although the two largest fish were hatchery strain.

      A series of rare earth elements (REEs) were evaluated as potential markers in scales of Atlantic salmon 1+ and 0+ smolt by addition of these elements to the feed. Chlorides of 5 REEs were tested, alone or in combination: lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd) and dysprosium (Dy). The labelled‐diets contained 125 or 250 mg REE kg−1 feed and were administered for up to 10 weeks. Fish scales were collected and analysed by inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) before start, 5 and 10 weeks after labelling started and finally 2 or 4 months after marking. The results demonstrated that the five tested elements were clearly incorporated into the scales of the fish fed the supplemented diets. Uptake and concentrations increased gradually during the feeding period, and no principal differences were found between the two smolt types. Combining 2 REEs in the same feed did not affect the incorporation of either of them. After a ‘dilution’‐period of 2–4 months the concentrations of all markers (except La) in the scales of the treated‐fish were still significantly higher than those of the untreated‐fish. The background concentrations of the tested markers and some other elements were also measured and found to give interesting information.

This article draws on recent theories of assemblage to consider the more-than-human geographies involved in the production of new consumer-oriented urban landscapes. Primarily drawing on Bruno Latour (2005), this article develops key conceptual tools through an examination of the Mall Paseo Chiloé in southern Chile and the more-than-human objects and processes that play a role in its inception. While this article is concerned with neoliberal retail capital and its expansion, this article focuses on how the possibilities for this expansion were produced, in part, by the force of techno-industrial salmon aquaculture that had arrived in the region in previous years. Importantly, this salmon-commodity holds together a series of human-environment relationships that make the arrival of the shopping mall possible in the first place. The mall is then conceptualized as an assemblage, with the salmon working as the linchpin that holds together multiple relations between the physical, built and emotional environments at the Chiloé archipelago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No fish, no mall.

      Abstract
      
         California's Central Valley contains an abundance of rivers with historical and potential productivity for anadromous salmonids, which are currently limited by impacts such as dams, water diversions, and high temperatures. We surveyed genetic variation in Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss within the upper Tuolumne and Merced rivers in and around Yosemite National Park to evaluate both population origins (ancestry) and the evolutionary response to natural and artificial barriers to migration (adaptation). This analysis revealed that despite extensive stocking with hatchery Rainbow Trout strains throughout the study area, most populations retained largely indigenous ancestry. Adaptive genomic variation associated with anadromy was distributed throughout the study area, with higher frequencies observed in populations connected to reservoirs that are known to support adfluvial life history variants. Fish in southern Central Valley rivers experience temperatures near the upper thermal limit for salmonids and represent an important reservoir of genomic diversity for adaptation to climate change. These results highlight the importance of local adaptation as well as the potential for resident Rainbow Trout populations above barrier dams to contribute to the recovery of steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout) once migratory connectivity is restored between upstream spawning and rearing habitats and the ocean.

Marine sediments are a major sink of organic matter, playing a crucial role in the global cycling of major elements. Macrofauna, through the reworking of particles and movement of solutes (bioturbation), enhances oxic conditions and the sediment metabolic capacity. Increases in the inputs of organic matter can lead to profound changes in the seabed and impact benthic ecological functions. Through a microcosm experiment, the effect of bioturbation of the polychaete Lumbrineris latreilli on biogeochemical fluxes under scenarios of increasing loads of organic matter was quantified. We found that bioturbation can buffer the negative consequences of anoxic conditions produced by organic enrichment, preventing the build-up of toxic by-products derived from anaerobic metabolic pathways by maintaining oxic conditions. However, the maintenance of oxic conditions by bioturbation is at the expense of limiting the sediment metabolic capacity. The maintenance of oxic conditions may limit anaerobic metabolic pathways, and consequently, the metabolic capacity of sediment. Thus, under organic matter pollution conditions, bioturbation may lessen the metabolic capacity of the sediment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bioturbation may not always enhance the metabolic capacity of organic polluted sediments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there is an increasing commercial and research interest towards the use of organic acids in aquafeeds, due to several beneficial effects they have on growth performance and intestinal tract’s health of farmed fish. Among organic acids, monoglycerides of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have attracted particular research attention also for their bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of SCFA and MCFA monoglycerides, used as a feed additive, on fish growth performance, and intestinal microbiota composition. For this purpose, a specific combination of short- and medium-chain 1-monoglycerides (SILOhealth 108Z) was tested in 600 juvenile gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) of about 60 g mean initial weight that were fed for 90 days with plant-based diets. Two isoproteic and isolipidic diets were formulated. The control fish group received a plant-based diet, whereas the other group received the same control feed, but supplemented with 0.5% of SILOhealth 108Z. The Illumina MiSeq platform for high-throughput amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and QIIME pipeline were used to analyse and characterize the whole microbiome associated both to feeds and S. aurata intestine. The number of reads taxonomically classified according to the Greengenes database was 394,611. We identified 259 OTUs at 97% identity in sea bream fecal samples; 90 OTUs constituted the core gut microbiota. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria represented the dominant phyla in both experimental groups. Among them, relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were positively and negatively affected by dietary SCFA monoglycerides supplementation, respectively. In summary, our findings clearly indicated that SILOhealth 108Z positively modulated the fish intestinal microbiota by increasing the number of beneficial lactic acid bacteria, namely, Lactobacillus, and reducing Gammaproteobacteria, which include several potential pathogenic bacteria. The specific composition of 1-monoglycerides of short- and medium-chain fatty acids contained in SILOhealth 108Z could thus have a great potential as a feed additive in aquaculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Effect of a specific composition of short- and medium-chain fatty acid 1-Monoglycerides on growth performances and gut microbiota of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata)

For this, we implemented a single-step continuous-time correlated-random-walk model which accommodates observational error and movement parameters variation in relation to oceanographic variables. Spatially explicit predictions of whales’ behavioral responses were combined with density predictions from previous species distribution models (SDM) and vessel tracking data to estimate the relative probability of vessels encountering whales and identifying areas where interaction is likely to occur. These estimations were conducted independently for the aquaculture, transport, artisanal fishery, and industrial fishery fleets operating in NCP. Blue whale movement patterns strongly agreed with SDM results, reinforcing our knowledge regarding oceanographic habitat selection drivers. By combining movement and density modeling approaches we provide a stronger support for purported priority areas for blue whale conservation and how they overlap with the main vessel traffic corridor in the NCP. The aquaculture fleet was one order of magnitude larger than any other fleet, indicating it could play a decisive role in modulating potential negative vessel-whale interactions within NCP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Defining priority areas for blue whale conservation and investigating overlap with vessel traffic in Chilean Patagonia, using a fast-fitting movement model",,,,,,,,,,

Marine sediments are a major sink of organic matter, playing a crucial role in the global cycling of major elements. Macrofauna, through the reworking of particles and movement of solutes (bioturbation), enhances oxic conditions and the sediment metabolic capacity. Increases in the inputs of organic matter can lead to profound changes in the seabed and impact benthic ecological functions. Through a microcosm experiment, the effect of bioturbation of the polychaete Lumbrineris latreilli on biogeochemical fluxes under scenarios of increasing loads of organic matter was quantified. We found that bioturbation can buffer the negative consequences of anoxic conditions produced by organic enrichment, preventing the build-up of toxic by-products derived from anaerobic metabolic pathways by maintaining oxic conditions. However, the maintenance of oxic conditions by bioturbation is at the expense of limiting the sediment metabolic capacity. The maintenance of oxic conditions may limit anaerobic metabolic pathways, and consequently, the metabolic capacity of sediment. Thus, under organic matter pollution conditions, bioturbation may lessen the metabolic capacity of the sediment.",,,,,,"Abstract. Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting comprise the most hazardous industry in the U.S., and production agriculture accounts for the majority of fatalities in the industry. Using Penn State‘s farm and agricultural injury database, data were coded according to ASABE‘s Farm and Agricultural Injury Classification (FAIC) code and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics‘ Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS) for source and event or exposure types. Occupational and non-occupational incidents were compared based on age groups, religious sect, source of injury, and the injury event or exposure. There were 355 farm and agricultural fatalities in Pennsylvania from 2000 through 2012, and 56% of these fatalities were occupational. The fatality rate was 33.4 per 100,000 farm household residents per year. Youth under 15 years old, seniors age 65 and older, Anabaptist youth, and young females were at high risk of fatal farm injury. Vehicles and transportation incidents were the most common injury source and event/exposure type, respectively. This research illustrates how state-level or national-level data can be collected, coded, and analyzed based on the FAIC and OIICS classification systems to better understand fatal injury causes and connections among important variables.

Understanding origin, spread and risk factors of disease is crucial for management, but data in the ocean are limited compared to the terrestrial environment. Here we investigated how the marine environment drives the spread of viral disease outbreak affecting The Pacific oyster worldwide by using a spatial epidemiology framework. We collected environmental and oyster health data at 46 sites spread over an area of 300 km2 along an inshore-offshore gradient during an epizootic event and conducted risk analysis. We found that disease broke out in the intertidal farming area and spread seaward. Mortalities and virus detection were observed in oysters placed 2 km from the farming areas, but oysters of almost all sites were subclinically infected. Increasing food quantity and quality, growth rate and energy reserves of oyster were associated with a lower risk of mortality offshore whereas increasing turbidity, a proxy of the concentration of suspended particulate matter, and terrestrial inputs, inferred from fatty acid composition of oysters, were associated with a higher risk of mortality.

         For the production and commercialization of ornamental fish species, it is indispensable to collect biometric data that facilitate the selection of animals for trade and genetic improvement of the stock. However, during the handling process, fish receive more stress if proper anesthetics are not used. Thus, application of appropriate anesthetics is an important tool for minimizing stress in animals. The objective of this study was to determine the effective concentrations of benzocaine, eugenol, and menthol for achieving anesthesia in Freshwater Angelfish Pterophyllum scalare and to develop induction and recovery response curves for different concentrations of these anesthetics. In total, 75 fish were exposed to five concentrations of the three anesthetics in a completely randomized design: benzocaine at 60, 85, 110, 135, and 160 mg/L; eugenol at 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mg/L; and menthol at 50, 75, 150, 200, and 250 mg/L. Each concentration (5 fish/concentration) consisted of five replicates, with each replicate represented by a single fish. The results indicated that the tested substances met the criteria of anesthetic efficiency. The effective concentrations of benzocaine, eugenol, and menthol for the anesthesia of Freshwater Angelfish were identified as 89.25, 90.6, and 92.1 mg/L, respectively.

This study examined the factors affecting productivity and constraints of commercial tilapia farms in the Dangme West District of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Primary data was obtained from 41 tilapia farms using multistage sampling. The data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis, and the agreements within ranked constraints was assessed. The empirical results revealed that the tilapia farmers in the three towns from which the data were collected, namely Achavanya, Kajanya and Dormeliam, produced a mean output of 74 kg per cage (6 m × 6 m × 3 m) as a productivity measure. Productivity of the cage farms were found to be positively affected by quantity of seed, feed and education level of managers; and negatively affected by cage size, labour and year of experience. Furthermore, the major constraints identified were high cost of inputs, lack of access to feed and credits and in adequate extension services and stealing of fish. The study suggests the need for supporting policies on inputs such as fingerlings and feed, and also providing education i.e. training to tilapia farmers. Efforts should also be made by financial institutions and NGOs to make credit easily available and accessible to commercial fish farmers so that they could cope with high cost of inputs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Productivity and constraints analysis of commercial tilapia farms in Ghana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the pelagic larval stage (4–12 dph), larvae reared at 3 lx showed a lower growth. From 19 onwards, the larvae reared under 3 lx displayed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) higher SGR than the other treatments and a higher final weight compared to 1000 lx and 500 lx. Survival rate was higher under intermediate light intensities (500 and 50 lx). Larvae reared at 3 lx displayed a significant delay in the degree of metamorphosis compared to the other treatments, while at 33 dph metamorphosis was completed under all treatments. Histological examination revealed the importance of vision and light in the first feeding of this species, while after metamorphosis, the full development of other sensory organs indicated that feeding activity is also mediated by chemosensory perception. Results indicate that high light intensity seems to be more suitable during the pelagic larvae, while the opposite would ensure better growth from the onset of metamorphosis to the benthic phase.

To restore native fish populations, fisheries programs often depend on active removal of aquatic invasive species. Chemical removal can be an effective method of eliminating aquatic invasive species, but chemicals can induce mortality in nontarget organisms and persist in the environment. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an emerging alternative to traditional chemical control agents because it has been demonstrated to be toxic to fish, but is naturally occurring and readily neutralized. In addition, CO2 is a commercially available gas, is highly soluble, and has high absorption efficiency. When these characteristics are paired with advances in modern, large-scale gas delivery technologies, opportunities to use CO2 in natural or artificial (e.g., canals) waters to manage fish become increasingly feasible.

In queenless experimental colonies, a single immature female worker typically became ovigerous, and no female workers matured in colonies with a resident queen.

",,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding why individuals within altruistic societies forgo reproduction to raise others’ offspring has fascinated scientists since Darwin. Although worker polymorphism is thought to have evolved only in sterile workers, worker subcastes appear to be common among social invertebrates and vertebrates. We asked whether sterility accompanies eusociality and morphological differentiation in snapping shrimps (Synalpheus)—the only known marine eusocial group. We show that workers in Synalpheus elizabethae are reproductively totipotent and that female—but not male—gonadal development and mating are mediated by the presence of a queen, apparently without physical aggression. In queenless experimental colonies, a single immature female worker typically became ovigerous, and no female workers matured in colonies with a resident queen. Thus, eusocial shrimp workers retain reproductive totipotency despite signs of morphological specialization. The failure of most female workers to mature is instead facultative and mediated by the presence of the queen, ensuring her reproductive monopoly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Control of Reproduction and Breeding Monopolization in the Eusocial Snapping Shrimp Synalpheus elizabethae,,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Control of Reproduction and Breeding Monopolization in the Eusocial Snapping Shrimp Synalpheus elizabethae,,,,,,,,,,,,

      The effects of four light intensities (1000 lx, 500 lx, 50 lx, 3 lx) on growth, survival and feeding activity in common sole (Solea solea L.) larvae were studied from 4 to 51 days post hatching (dph). During the pelagic larval stage (4–12 dph), larvae reared at 3 lx showed a lower growth. From 19 onwards, the larvae reared under 3 lx displayed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) higher SGR than the other treatments and a higher final weight compared to 1000 lx and 500 lx. Survival rate was higher under intermediate light intensities (500 and 50 lx).

",,"China’s 13th Five-Year Plan, launched in March 2016, provides a sound policy platform for the protection of marine ecosystems and the restoration of capture fisheries within China’s exclusive economic zone. What distinguishes China among many other countries striving for marine fisheries reform is its size—accounting for almost one-fifth of global catch volume—and the unique cultural context of its economic and resource management. In this paper, we trace the history of Chinese government priorities, policies, and outcomes related to marine fisheries since the 1978 Economic Reform, and examine how the current leadership’s agenda for “ecological civilization” could successfully transform marine resource management in the coming years. We show how China, like many other countries, has experienced a decline in the average trophic level of its capture fisheries during the past few decades, and how its policy design, implementation, and enforcement have influenced the status of its wild fish stocks. To reverse the trend in declining fish stocks, the government is introducing a series of new programs for sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, with greater traceability and accountability in marine resource management and area controls on coastal development. As impressive as these new plans are on paper, we conclude that serious institutional reforms will be needed to achieve a true paradigm shift in marine fisheries management in China. In particular, we recommend new institutions for science-based fisheries management, secure fishing access, policy consistency across provinces, educational programs for fisheries managers, and increasing public access to scientific data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Opportunity for marine fisheries reform in China,Opportunity for marine fisheries reform in China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve an efficient biotechnology for all-female aquaculture in the economically important prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), we achieved – for the first time – WW males using androgenic gland cells transplantation which caused full sex-reversal of WW females to functional males. Crossing the WW males with WW females yielded all-female progeny lacking the Z chromosome. We now have the ability to manipulate – by non-genomic means – all possible genotype combinations (ZZ, WZ and WW) to retain either male or female phenotypes and hence to produce monosex populations of either gender. This calls for a study of the genomic basis underlying this striking sexual plasticity, questioning the content of the W and Z chromosomes. Here, we report on the sequencing of a high-quality genome exhibiting distinguishable paternal and maternal sequences. This assembly covers ~ 87.5% of the genome and yielded a remarkable N50 value of ~ 20 × 106 bp.

Myanmar's fisheries are among the most important globally but remain some of the least documented. The fisheries sector occupies an important place in Myanmar's economy and culture, and is set to change rapidly as the country enters a period of unprecedented political and economic transition. Building on a unique set of information sources, this article presents a broad view of the current state of knowledge on governance, livelihoods, production and supply chains across Myanmar's three main fishery sub-sectors (marine capture, inland capture, and aquaculture). The analysis is contextualized with a review of major changes in the country's policy history affecting fisheries. It is argued that Myanmar's fisheries now sit at a potential cross-road in terms of their governance. Taking advantage of Myanmar's latecomer position in its current transition, this article draws parallels with regional experiences to outline sectoral recommendations for policy reform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Myanmar's fisheries in transition: Current status and opportunities for policy reform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With intensification, Asian seabass are prone to infectious diseases such as vibriosis that could lead to additional costs in the grow-out cage culture system. Other costs include feeds, fingerlings and antibiotics. To improve awareness to the costs, the objective of this study is to estimate the costs of Asian seabass that include endemic vibriosis. First, farm-level costs were estimated using a questionnaire performed to 20 monoculture of Asian seabass farms. Second, the costs of grow-out at cage culture Asian seabass in 210 days was estimated using stochastic bioeconomic model. Model developed included uncertainty in vibriosis prevalence, mortality and variation in body weight to be estimated as costs. Inputs in the model were based on literature, expert opinion and outcomes in the current survey. Survey results showed that the participating farms did not have Malaysian Good Aquaculture Practices (GAqP) certificate. The median cost to produce 1,500 tails of fish (1 kg/tail) in 12 months was USD 4,688/farm/cycle. The stochastic model estimated total cost to produce a tail of fish (1,079 g/tail) as USD 3.61 consisting of variable costs such as feeds (USD 3.51), fixed costs such as maintenance (USD 0.12) and provision costs due to mortality (USD 0.35). Total vibriosis costs (mortality, diagnosis and treatment costs) were USD 0.24/tail. The total cost was sensitive to change in feed conversion ratio (FCR) and mortality due to other causes. Improving farm efficiency and increasing production cycle to 1.73 times/year is necessary to lower the costs. Government should give more priority in research and development of cheaper feed alternatives, probiotics and vaccines. Farmers should be aware of the costs and make a better decision, for example improving FCR and biosecurity to improve profitability. Care must be taken to interpret the findings as the costs of grow-out Asian seabass is different for each farm due to different management practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Costs of management practices of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer Bloch, 1790) cage culture in Malaysia using stochastic model that includes uncertainty in mortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also conducted a survey of seven hazardous chemicals in fish sampled from farms (300 samples from 100 farms) and of 5 biological hazards as well as total bacterial counts in fish sampled from retailers (300 samples from 100 retailers). The results showed that the level of contamination with heavy metals and pesticides was lower than the national and international permissible limits. On the other hand, level of contamination of a considerable proportion of samples with microbial pollutants was higher than the permissible limits. Results from the literature indicated that, the level of contamination of wild tilapia was higher than farmed tilapia, again in contradiction to common perceptions. Our results indicate that the risk of human exposure to heavy metals and pesticides via consumption of farmed tilapia is negligible compared to microbial hazards.

Anisakidosis is a zoonotic parasitosis induced by members of the family Anisakidae. The anisakid genera includes Anisakis, Pseudoterranova, Hysterothylacium and Contracaecum. The final definitive hosts of these nematodes are marine mammals with a complex life cycle. These nematode parasites use different crustaceans and fish species as intermediate or paratenic hosts and humans are accidental hosts. Human anisakiasis, the infections caused by members of the genus Anisakis, occurs, when seafoods, particularly fish, contaminated with the infective stage (third stage larvae [L3]) of this parasite, are consumed. Pseudoterranovosis, on the other hand is induced by members of the genus Pseudoterranova. These two genera of anisakids have been implicated in human disease globally. There is a rise in reports of gastro-intestinal infections accompanied by allergic reactions caused by Anisakis simplex and Anisakis pegreffii. This review provides an update on current knowledge on Anisakis as a food-borne parasite with special focus on the increasingly reported diversity of fish and crustacean hosts, allergens and immunological cross-reactivity with invertebrate proteins rendering this parasite a significant public health issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anisakis Nematodes in Fish and Shellfish- from infection to allergies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-halamines are one of the most effective antimicrobial agents against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. In this study, 1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazolidinone (MC, a variety of N-halamine) was coated on nonwoven fabrics to give the fabric antimicrobial activity against the AI virus. Results showed that MC exhibited potent antiviral activity either in suspension or in the air. Higher concentrations of MC completely inactivated AI viruses and disrupted their RNA, preventing them from being detected by the real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Coating the fabrics with MC resulted in remarkably reduced presence of AI virus on the MC-treated fabric in a short period of time. Furthermore, aerosolized AI viruses were completely inactivated when they passed through filters coated with the MC compound. In addition, MC is not volatile and does not release any gaseous chlorine. The active chlorine in the MC compound is stable, and the coating procedure is straightforward and inexpensive.

"Abstract

Airborne pathogens are one of the most common avenues leading to poultry diseases. Preventing the avian influenza (AI) virus from entering the chicken hatchery house is critical for reducing the spread and transmission of AI disease. Many studies have investigated the incorporation of antimicrobials into air filters to prevent viruses from entering the indoor environment. N-halamines are one of the most effective antimicrobial agents against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. In this study, 1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazolidinone (MC, a variety of N-halamine) was coated on nonwoven fabrics to give the fabric antimicrobial activity against the AI virus. Results showed that MC exhibited potent antiviral activity either in suspension or in the air. Higher concentrations of MC completely inactivated AI viruses and disrupted their RNA, preventing them from being detected by the real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Coating the fabrics with MC resulted in remarkably reduced presence of AI virus on the MC-treated fabric in a short period of time. Furthermore, aerosolized AI viruses were completely inactivated when they passed through filters coated with the MC compound. In addition, MC is not volatile and does not release any gaseous chlorine. The active chlorine in the MC compound is stable, and the coating procedure is straightforward and inexpensive. Therefore, this study validates a novel approach to reducing airborne pathogens in the poultry production environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The edible seaweed Caulerpa lentillifera, a powerful natural food source that is rich in protein, minerals, dietary fibers, vitamins, saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids, has been mass cultured in some Asian countries and has been the focus of researchers in recent years.

We estimate growth as change in planar area for 11 species, across five morphological groups and over 5 years. We show that coral growth rates are best predicted from colony size and morphology rather than species. Coral size follows a power scaling law with a constant exponent of 0.91.

The recently emerged coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has been characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is impacting all parts of human society including agriculture, manufacturing, and tertiary sectors involving all service provision industries. This paper aims to give an overview of potential host reservoirs that could cause pandemic outbreak caused by zoonotic transmission. Amongst all, continues surveillance in slaughterhouse for possible pathogens transmission is needed to prevent next pandemic outbreak. This paper also summarizes the potential threats of pandemic to agriculture and aquaculture sector that control almost the total food supply chain and market. The history lesson from the past, emerging and reemerging infectious disease including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Influenza A H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and the recent COVID-19 should give us some clue to improve especially the governance to be more ready for next coming pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Covid-19 pandemic in the lens of food safety and security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Captive propagation and augmentation of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow Hybognathus amarus is necessary for continued persistence of the species until habitat can be restored. Augmentation occurs using captive fish within the first year (age 0) through age 2; however, older year‐classes (ages 3–4) have been released into the wild. We quantified fecundity and compared egg quality across four reproductive age‐classes (1–4) of hatchery‐reared Rio Grande Silvery Minnow. Batch fecundity (total number of spawned eggs) ranged from 2,029 eggs in age‐1 fish to 10,588 eggs in age‐4 fish. Standing stock of vitellogenic (i.e., yolked) oocytes remaining in ovaries after spawning increased from 988 oocytes at age 1 to 4,924 oocytes at age 4. Total fecundity (i.e., batch fecundity plus standing stock of yolked oocytes) increased from 3,017 eggs and yolked oocytes in age‐1 fish to 15,522 eggs and yolked oocytes in age‐4 fish. Of note, batch fecundity ranged from 57% to 68% across the four age‐classes indicating that over half of the total fecundity occurs in the first spawn. Average percent fertilization of eggs (63–82%) was not detectably different across the four age‐classes, while average egg diameter (4.1–5.5 mm) increased as age increased. Fecundity increased across all four reproductive age‐classes of Rio Grande Silvery Minnow, with the larger portion of total fecundity occurring in the first spawn across all age‐classes. The timing of spawning with optimal conditions in the Rio Grande is critical for survival and ultimately recruitment into the wild fish population.

Currently, no information is available about the presence of AMR Escherichia coli strains and the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) they harbor within hatchezries. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible involvement of hatcheries in harboring hemolytic AMR E. coli. Serotyping of the 65 isolated hemolytic E. coli revealed 15 serotypes with the ability to produce moderate biofilms, and shared susceptibility to cephradine and fosfomycin and resistance to spectinomycin. The most common β-lactam resistance gene was blaTEM, followed by blaOXA-1, blaMOX-like, blaCIT-like, blaSHV and blaFOX. Hierarchical clustering of E. coli isolates based on their phenotypic and genotypic profiles revealed separation of the majority of isolates from hatchlings and the hatchery environments, suggesting that hatchling and environmental isolates may have different origins. The high frequency of β-lactam resistance genes in AMR E. coli from chick hatchlings indicates that hatcheries may be a reservoir of AMR E. coli and can be a major contributor to the increased environmental burden of ARGs posing an eminent threat to poultry and human health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Poultry hatcheries as potential reservoirs for antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli: A risk to public health and food safety,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we put forth and tested the hypothesis of avian reservoirs of A. baumannii. We screened tracheal and rectal swab samples from livestock (chicken, geese) and wild birds (white stork nestlings) and isolated A. baumannii from 3% of sampled chicken (n = 220), 8% of geese (n = 40) and 25% of white stork nestlings (n = 661). Virulence of selected avian A. baumannii isolates was comparable to that of clinical isolates in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Whole genome sequencing revealed the close relationship of an antibiotic‐susceptible chicken isolate from Germany with a multidrug‐resistant human clinical isolate from China and additional linkages between livestock isolates and human clinical isolates related to international clonal lineages. Moreover, we identified stork isolates related to human clinical isolates from the United States. Multilocus sequence typing disclosed further kinship between avian and human isolates. Avian isolates do not form a distinct clade within the phylogeny of A. baumannii, instead they diverge into different lineages. Further, we provide evidence that A. baumannii is constantly present in the habitats occupied by storks. Collectively, our study suggests A. baumannii could be a zoonotic organism that may disseminate into livestock.

Augmentation occurs using captive fish within the first year (age 0) through age 2; however, older year‐classes (ages 3–4) have been released into the wild. We quantified fecundity and compared egg quality across four reproductive age‐classes (1–4) of hatchery‐reared Rio Grande Silvery Minnow. Batch fecundity (total number of spawned eggs) ranged from 2,029 eggs in age‐1 fish to 10,588 eggs in age‐4 fish. Standing stock of vitellogenic (i.e., yolked) oocytes remaining in ovaries after spawning increased from 988 oocytes at age 1 to 4,924 oocytes at age 4. Total fecundity (i.e., batch fecundity plus standing stock of yolked oocytes) increased from 3,017 eggs and yolked oocytes in age‐1 fish to 15,522 eggs and yolked oocytes in age‐4 fish. Of note, batch fecundity ranged from 57% to 68% across the four age‐classes indicating that over half of the total fecundity occurs in the first spawn. Average percent fertilization of eggs (63–82%) was not detectably different across the four age‐classes, while average egg diameter (4.1–5.5 mm) increased as age increased. Fecundity increased across all four reproductive age‐classes of Rio Grande Silvery Minnow, with the larger portion of total fecundity occurring in the first spawn across all age‐classes.

We find that gender intersects with caste, income, geographic location, age, and household membership to create heterogeneous experiences and knowledge that reflects the complexities associated with gender and environmental change. With specific regard to the increase in fisherwomen out-migrating, we show that responses and adaptations to environmental change have gender-differentiated impacts and challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Women’s perspectives of small-scale fisheries and environmental change in Chilika lagoon, India",,,,,,,,,,

Ocean renewable technologies have been rapidly developing over the past years. However, current high installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning costs are hindering these offshore technologies to reach a commercialization stage. In this paper we focus on the use of divers and remotely-operated vehicles during the installation and monitoring phase of wave energy converters. Methods and results are based on the wave energy converter system developed by Uppsala University, and our experience in offshore deployments obtained during the past eleven years. The complexity of underwater operations, carried out by either divers or remotely-operated vehicles, is emphasized. Three methods for the deployment of wave energy converters are economically and technically analyzed and compared: one using divers alone, a fully-automated approach using remotely-operated vehicles, and an intermediate approach, involving both divers and underwater vehicles. The monitoring of wave energy converters by robots is also studied, both in terms of costs and technical challenges. The results show that choosing an autonomous deployment method is more advantageous than a diver-assisted method in terms of operational time, but that numerous factors prevent the wide application of robotized operations. Technical solutions are presented to enable the use of remotely-operated vehicles instead of divers in ocean renewable technology operations. Economically, it is more efficient to use divers than autonomous vehicles for the deployment of six or fewer wave energy converters. From seven devices, remotely-operated vehicles become advantageous.

"Abstract

The probiotic effects of seven newly isolated gut bacteria, from the indegenous honey bees of Saudi Arabia were investigated. In vivo bioassays were used to investigate the effects of each gut bacterium namely, Fructobacillus fructosus (T1), Proteus mirabilis (T2), Bacillus licheniformis (T3), Lactobacillus kunkeei (T4), Bacillus subtilis (T5), Enterobacter kobei (T6), and Morganella morganii (T7) on mortality percentage of honey bee larvae infected with P. larvae spores along with negative control (normal diet) and positive control (normal diet spiked with P. larvae spores). Addition of gut bacteria to the normal diet significantly reduced the mortality percentage of the treated groups. Mortality percentage in all treated groups ranged from 56.67% up to 86.67%. T6 treated group exhibited the highest mortality (86.67%), whereas T4 group showed the lowest mortality (56.67%). Among the seven gut bacterial treatments, T4 and T3 decreased the mortality 56.67% and 66.67%, respectively, whereas, for T2, T6, and T7 the mortality percentage was equal to that of the positive control (86.67%). Mortality percentages in infected larval groups treated with T1, and T5 were 78.33% and 73.33% respectively. Most of the mortality occurred in the treated larvae during days 2 and 3.

However, the effectiveness of anaesthesia often varies according to the anaesthetic agent, species, temperature, dosage, and interactions among these factors. This study evaluated the effects of eugenol on three sizes of the shrimp Palaemonetes sinensis at different concentrations and temperatures. Eugenol dose, water temperature, and shrimp size were found to significantly influence anaesthesia in P. sinensis. Induction time decreased linearly with increasing water temperature and eugenol concentration, while it increased with body weight. However, recovery times lengthened with increasing concentration and temperature, and shortened with lower body size. At 100 and 200 μL/L eugenol concentrations, the survival rates of medium and large shrimps were maintained at over 80% at all temperatures studied over 72 h recovery. However, the survival rates of small shrimps were below 60% at 24 °C and 28 °C over 5 days of recovery.

"Abstract
Background

Despite recent improvements of wastewater treatment capacities in urban areas of Hanoi, Vietnam, microbial pollution is still considerable. There is a paucity of burden estimates due to gastrointestinal infection in people living along the wastewater system, and among people who are in direct contact with the wastewater, such as farmers using wastewater in agriculture and aquaculture.

Methods

A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was pursued focussing on four population groups characterised by different levels of exposure to wastewater: (i) workers maintaining the wastewater conveyance and treatment systems; (ii) urban farmers using wastewater from To Lich River; (iii) community members in urban areas exposed to flooding events in the districts of Hoang Mai and Thanh Tri; and (iv) peri-urban farmers in Thanh Tri district, where Red River water is used for agriculture and aquaculture. The QMRA was developed on the basis of measured concentration of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. and Ascaris spp. eggs in water samples. Published ratios between measured organisms and pathogenic strains of norovirus, rotavirus, Campylobacter spp., pathogenic E. coli, pathogenic Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Ascaris lumbricoides were employed to estimate annual risk of gastrointestinal infection and disease burden.

Results

The QMRA estimated a disease burden of 0.011 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per person per year in urban farmers, 0.006 DALYs for sanitation workers, 0.0005 DALYs for urban communities at risk of flooding events and 0.0004 DALYs for peri-urban farmers. Urban farmers had considerably higher incidence estimates for gastrointestinal disease episodes per year (2.0) compared to the other exposure groups (≤ 1.0).

Conclusions

Urban farmers using wastewater from To Lich River have a high gastrointestinal disease burden, which is about 100 times larger than the health-based targets for wastewater use set by the World Health Organization. These findings are of direct public health relevance and call for upgrading Hanoi's wastewater system to reduce microbial contamination. Finally, this study presents a first example on how to link QMRA to a sanitation safety planning (SSP) approach in an Asian context and its findings are interesting in the frame of Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) #6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Disease burden due to gastrointestinal infections among people living along the major wastewater system in Hanoi, Vietnam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         The Gulf Killifish Fundulus grandis, a popular baitfish species inhabiting estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico, has potential as an aquaculture species, particularly if it can be produced in low‐salinity or freshwater ponds. Because growth and survival in freshwater ponds are not known, two size‐classes were examined over a 16‐week period. Initial mean stocking weights and densities were 0.47 g/fish and 26,500 fish/ha for the smaller size‐group, which was stocked into three 0.04‐ha ponds, and 6.12 g/fish and 20,450 fish/ha for the larger size‐group, which was stocked into two 0.04‐ha ponds. Growth and survival were similar between size‐classes: mean final weight and mean survival were 7.88 g/fish and 54.3%, respectively, for the smaller size‐group, and 13.90 g/fish and 43.1% for the larger size‐group. Mean weight gain was very similar between size‐groups (small: 7.41 g; large: 7.78 g); steady growth was observed from June until mid‐September, whereas little growth and declines in condition factor were observed from mid‐September to mid‐October, corresponding with decreases in water temperature. Gulf Killifish were resilient to a wide range of water quality conditions in freshwater ponds and reached market sizes of 3 g at about 4 weeks and 5 g by 8 weeks.

We analyze the impact of land fragmentation on household income in rural Vietnam. Vietnam offers an especially interesting case study as fragmentation has been a direct outcome of land reforms since the early 1990s. Our study provides the first evidence that land fragmentation has negative consequences for household income, possibly because of its negative effects on crop income. Notably, using the Instrumental Variables (IV) method, we find that the negative effect is much greater after addressing the endogeneity of land fragmentation. IV analysis, therefore, suggests that a conventional approach which often uses the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, ignoring the endogeneity of land fragmentation, is likely to underestimate the impact of land fragmentation on rural households. In addition, we find that the occupation of household heads was a major factor contributing to household income. Household income was also largely determined by some commune-level factors, such as road access, susceptibility to natural disasters and economic conditions. Our findings offer two key policy implications: (i) reducing land fragmentation would minimize its negative consequences for household income by reducing its negative effect on crop income; (ii) there is a need to increase job opportunities for rural households by improving access to better education, and increasing the demand for skilled labour. Both measures should be of practical use in rural areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Land fragmentation and household income: First evidence from rural Vietnam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      This article explores what is meant by the term fishing ‘community’ by evidencing shared ‘communities of the mind’ from people living and working in coastal areas linked to fishing. Using empirical data collected through in‐depth interviews and participant observation in three Scottish case‐study locations, this article identifies three key features that support the underpinning resilience of fishing communities: a connection to, and empathy with, those involved in fishing; the valuing of freedom and autonomy associated with a positive fishing identity; and a closing of ranks against the three external spectres of ‘policy’, ‘science’ and ‘the public’. The controversies that arise at the interface between current fisheries management systems and the heterogeneous nature of the fishing ‘community’ suggest that policymakers may need to pay more attention to communities of the mind, taking into account the strength of attachment to fishing as a positive identity and the substantial commitment to the sector that people show.

While feed efficiency is highly important in aquaculture fish, little genetic and genomic progresses have been made for this trait. In this study, we constructed a high-resolution genetic linkage map in a full-sib F1 family of crucian carp (Carassius auratus) consisting of 113 progenies with 8,460 SNP markers assigning onto 50 linkage groups (LGs). This genetic map spanned 4,047.824 cM (0.478 cM/marker) and covered 98.76% of the crucian carp genome. 35 chromosome-wide QTL affecting feed conversion efficiency (FCE, 8 QTL), relative growth rate (RGR, 9 QTL), average daily gain (ADG, 13 QTL) and average daily feed intake (ADFI, 5 QTL) were detected on 14 LGs, explaining 14.0–20.9% of the phenotypic variations. In LGs of LG16, LG25, LG36 and LG49, several QTL affecting different traits clustered together at the identical or close regions of the same linkage group. Seven candidate genes, whose biological functions may involve in the energy metabolism, digestion, biosynthesis and signal transduction, were identified from these QTL intervals by comparative genomics analysis.

Aquaponics, an innovation in agricultural systems of production and food supply which combines aquaculture fish production with hydroponic production of vegetables, represents a valuable option to overcome the food needs of a constantly increasing world population, it can do so by improving production and supply with less inputs and in a sustainable way. Despite recent developments in this scientific area, there are still not enough commercial firms at a European level that allow for a consistent view of how this activity is evolving in society, as well as, to understand the impact of Aquaponics Hub in promoting the development of this activity in Europe - aquaponics is still at an early age and, despite innovative, it needs time to grow and evolve.

Thus, we used Google Trends data and a quantitative methodology, multivariate analysis and econometric models, in order to both nowcast and forecast insights about the importance, the role and the new trends in aquaponics. The results show an interesting trend of increasing popularity in aquaponics search terms as a proxi of aquaponics development in Europe, mainly in all the European countries belonging to the Aquaponics Hub. However, we conclude that there is still a long way to go for aquaponics before it becomes a commercial activity at economic level. Hence, European and public decision-makers are urged to be more concerned about legislation and the allocation of funds for research and for the commercial investment of companies and for their promotion and development in aquaponics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nowcasting and forecasting aquaponics by Google Trends in European countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through small-scale experiments, several factors relevant for an on-going large-scale production of Rhodomonas were studied and the results presented here provide a useful insight on factors that can help future large-scale production. The content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the temporal sedimentation was compared in five strains of Rhodomonas. Strain K-1487 (R. salina) was chosen as the most suitable for cultivation in PBRs due to a good biochemical content of PUFAs and low cell sedimentation. The f/2 growth medium used for cultivation was modified by excluding CoCl2 which did not affect either growth rate or cell content of the PUFAs, DHA, EPA, and ARA. Furthermore, the growth medium was modified by adding the nitrogen source as ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), urea, or combinations of these, with NH4+ yielding a significantly higher growth rate of 1.30 ± 0.07 day−1. The seawater used for cultivation was exposed to three types of treatments which gave no significant difference in the growth rate: (1) filtration (0.2 μm) + autoclaving, (2) filtration (0.2 μm) + UV-radiation, and (3) filtration (0.2 μm). Finally, the results for growth rates of inocula at initial densities ranging from 2000 to 200,000 cells mL−1 showed that growth rate decreased with increasing density but a final density of 106 cells mL−1 was obtained fastest with the highest initial density.

We hypothesized that food companies could identify risks and implement improvements by adding a labor safety dimension to their tracking and traceability systems. We designed a five-point framework—the Labor Safe Screen—and tested it for 118 products. The framework combines the use of technology in existing platforms with the collection of industry data and authoritative human rights data. Eighteen food companies used three or more components of the framework and systematically documented their supply chains, engaged suppliers, and cross-checked results. The companies were able to identify areas where working conditions met minimum principles, were unknown, or were inadequate. Three companies also incorporated direct worker feedback to focus resources and improve working conditions.

Given that COVID-19 shutdown multiple core services (such as aviation, food services, supply chains, and export and import markets), there is an enormous deficiency in critical information to inform priority decision making for companies where this uncertainly is likely to impact negatively upon recovery.

The current article investigates potential innovations within the era of the COVID-19 crisis after framing them within the four issues of the food sector (food safety, bioactive food compounds, food security, and sustainability) that are directly affected by the pandemic. The prospect of foreseen innovations to disrupt the food sector during lockdown periods and the post-COVID-19 era is also discussed.

Key findings and conclusions

Internet and Communication Technologies, blockchain in the food supply chain and other Industry 4.0 applications, as well as approaches that redefine the way we consume food (e.g., lab-grown meat, plant-based alternatives of meat, and valorization of a vast range of bioresources), are the innovations with the highest potential in the new era. There is also an equally pressing need to exploit social marketing to understand attitudes, perceptions, and barriers that influence the behavior change of consumers and the agri-food industry.

Growing concerns for wild fish populations, and decreased efficiencies and burgeoning costs of lice treatments for farmed fish has necessitated more environmentally and socially acceptable delousing procedures, such as hyposaline treatments. The effect of brackish water on L. salmonis following primary attachment is largely unknown, with experimental evidence derived mostly from unattached or newly attached copepodids, or adult stages. We aimed to understand how attached lice respond to hyposaline environments to assess effectiveness as a parasite management strategy and to help better define delousing areas used by wild fish. Louse development at 4, 12, 19 and 26 ppt, and survival at 4 ppt, decreased as exposure times increased, but survival was otherwise unaffected. Subjecting salmon to fluctuating, repeat exposures did not influence efficacy. We confirm that free-swimming stages are susceptible, and show that attached copepodids were more tolerant than previously predicted based on experiments on alternate development stages. These results improve our understanding of the utility of hyposaline treatments in aquaculture and self-treating in wild fish, and could apply to other fish-lice parasite systems. Further, these data are important for models predicting host-parasite interactions and can contribute to predictive models on the transmission dynamics of sea lice from farm to wild fish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The effectiveness of hyposaline treatments against host-attached salmon lice,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

The Sundarban Mangrove Forest (SMF) is an intricate ecosystem containing the most varied and profuse natural resources of Bangladesh. This study presents empirical research, based on primary and secondary data, regarding the social-ecological system (SES), social-ecological dynamics, different stakeholders and relevant management policies of small-scale or artisanal fisheries such as the SMF; showing how, despite extensive diversification, the livelihood activities of the artisanal fishers in the SMF all depend on the forest itself. Regardless of this critical importance of mangroves, however, deforestation continues due to immature death of mangroves, illegal logging, increased salinity, natural disasters and significant household consumption of mangrove wood by local people. As the mangroves are destroyed fish stocks, and other fishery resources are reduced, leading to moves of desperation among those whose livelihood has traditionally been fishing. The present study also considers several risks and shock factors in the fishers' livelihood: attacks by wild animals (especially tigers) and local bandits, illness, natural disasters, river bank erosion, and the cost of paying off corrupt officials. The artisanal fishers of the SMF have adopted different strategies for coping with these problems: developing partnerships, violating the fisheries management laws and regulations, migrating, placing greater responsibility on women, and bartering fishing knowledge and information. This study shows how the social component (human), the ecological component (mangrove resources) and the interphase aspects (local ecological knowledge, stakeholder's interest, and money lenders or middle man roles) of the SMF as an SES are linked in mutual interaction. It furthermore considers how the social-ecological dynamics of the SMF have negative impacts on artisanal fishermen's livelihoods. Hence there is an urgency to update existing policies and management issues for the sustainable utilization of the SMF resources, eventually contributing to the improvement of the artisanal fishers' livelihoods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social-ecological dynamics of the small scale fisheries in Sundarban Mangrove Forest, Bangladesh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract

Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho’s rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of −27.6 ± 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD $8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the ∼600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of −16.56 ± 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sex reversal changes the sex ratio of populations and may complicate breeding schemes. In the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), genetic females may change into pseudomales, thereby increasing aquaculture costs because of the lower growth rate of the males than that of the females. Here we identify a new locus associated with sex reversal; this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in the third intron of the doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1) gene on the Z chromosome (named Cyn_Z_8564889) and has two alleles, A and G. Cyn_Z_8564889 regulates sex reversal interactively with our previously detected SNP (Cyn_Z_6676874), with the genetic females simultaneously carrying the T allele of Cyn_Z_6676874 and the A allele of Cyn_Z_8564889 changing into pseudomales. Other Dmrt1 polymorphisms were detected, which formed two haplotypes. Two SNPs in the second exon of Dmrt1 result in amino acid changes, suggesting that Dmrt1 is essential in sex reversal. We also verified that pseudomales produce no or little W sperm. The interaction and linkage between Cyn_Z_6676874 and Cyn_Z_8564889 and the absence of W sperm from pseudomales unravel the genetic architecture of sex reversal in C. semilaevis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New locus reveals the genetic architecture of sex reversal in the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis),,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract

The aims of this study were to assess the knowledge, attitudes and self-reported practices regarding seafood safety and the risk perception of seafood-borne diseases among seafood workers and to study the relationships among these variables. This study was cross-sectional, and the data collection was conducted using questionnaires administered through face-to-face interviews with 193 seafood workers in Brazil. Of these workers, 49.8% handled fish on fishery boats (Fishery Workers, FWs) and 50.2% were seafood handlers in two seafood warehouses (Seafood Warehouse Workers, SWWs). A minority of the seafood workers (33.7%) had participated in at least one food-safety training session. The knowledge and attitudes scores of the SWWs were higher than the scores of the FWs. However, no difference was observed between the self-reported practice scores of the SWWs and FWs. The mean level of risk perception score of the SWWs was higher than that of the FWs; nevertheless, both groups were classified as having an average risk perception of seafood-borne diseases. The risk perception score was correlated with the knowledge and attitude scores in both groups. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the attitude score and the age of the worker were related to the self-reported practice scores of both groups. These results showed the need for immediate actions to improve the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding food safety and handling to ensure the production of seafood that is safe for consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seafood safety: Knowledge, attitudes, self-reported practices and risk perceptions of seafood workers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flooding causes huge economic losses, yet the flood water is an important resource, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Because rivers flood annually, most flooding research has focused on river management. Researchers have largely ignored the resource potential of flash floods, as they are less predictable. Here, we describe an innovative project in which disaster management planners in a dryland community in northwestern China treated flash floods as a resource rather than as a threat, and helped the community to benefit from this resource. The project produced ecological benefits (combating desertification), social benefits (flood control), and economic benefits (harvesting water for future use) that improved the community’s adaptive capacity and facilitated sustainable development. This example should inspire risk managers to seek ways to transform natural disasters into resources, thereby improving hazard management and promoting community survival and development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transforming flash floods into resources in arid China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

         Telemetry studies often assume a lack of adverse effects caused by tag attachment and presence in various species and size‐classes, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions about fish behavior in field studies. Studies that examine the effects of tagging are typically performed on salmonids and adult fishes rather than on the small fishes that are increasingly becoming the focus of telemetry studies. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of intracoelomic acoustic tagging on growth, condition, survival, and tag retention in subadult hatchery Bloaters Coregonus hoyi (a focal species for restoration efforts in the Laurentian Great Lakes) and to determine the maximum tag burden below which tag effects are reduced. Fish were either tagged with one of three dummy acoustic transmitters (Vemco V6: n = 50; V7: n = 50; V9: n = 50) or were followed as controls (n = 50; anesthesia, PIT‐tagging, and handling only) or sham individuals (n = 49; anesthesia, surgery, suturing, and PIT‐tagging but no acoustic tag implanted). Tags represented 1.3–9.0% of body mass. All fish received a PIT tag for individual identification throughout the 6‐month monitoring period (November 2014–May 2015). Survival exceeded 90% in all treatment groups, and the tag retention rate was 100%. All surviving fish appeared healthy and in excellent condition at the conclusion of the experiment. The results of this study suggest that acoustic transmitters with a tag mass : body mass ratio of 9% or less can be successfully implanted intracoelomically into subadult Bloaters—small, laterally compressed pelagic fish—with no adverse effects.

In particular, little is known regarding whether households are implementing incremental or transformational adaptation measures as well as the implications of this for adaptation planning. We demonstrate the suitability of the risk hazard approach for understanding autonomous household adaptation patterns and discuss the implications for planned adaptation. To achieve this, we use an in-depth village case study from an area of Bangladesh particularly vulnerable to climate change, using qualitative semi-structured household interviews as primary material. We find that the risk hazard approach is ideal for exploring autonomous adaptations because of its capacity for understanding how households respond to livelihood risk, and what resources are required for it to be most effective.

In this Perspective, we explore MHW predictability on short-term, interannual to decadal, and centennial timescales, focusing on the physical processes that offer prediction. While there may be potential predictability of MHWs days to years in advance, accuracy will vary dramatically depending on the regions and drivers.

Background

In Vietnam, large amounts of pesticides are being used in agriculture. Next to benefits for agriculture, pesticides impose a huge threat to the environment when they are used in the wrong way. The objective of this work was to determine the level of knowledge and awareness of the smallholder farmers towards the use of pesticides in Vietnam, Dà Lat region. Based on the collected data, an occupational and environmental risk assessment was performed.

Results

The results indicate that the majority of the pesticide operators in the strawberry and chrysanthemum crops have a rather high education. Pesticide knowledge, on the other hand, is usually gained through experience with pests and diseases. Only 30% of the farmers consulted a pesticide specialist or government stewardship for information on (new) pesticide products. Pesticide usage is rather high with application frequencies up to once every three days during the wet season. Pesticide packages are stored to be incinerated (51%) or to be thrown away with the garbage/taken to the landfill (37%). Only a small percentage disposes the packages into the local river (2%). The use of personal protection equipment is well established. Occupational risk assessment showed that the re-entry worker is exposed to a high risk.

Conclusion

While a general awareness of the hazard of pesticides to human health and the environment is present, practical implementation of this awareness, however, is still limited in strawberry and chrysanthemum crop. The environmental risk evaluation indicated plant protection products of which the use should be limited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pesticide knowledge and practice among horticultural workers in the Lâm Đồng region, Vietnam: A case study of chrysanthemum and strawberries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
